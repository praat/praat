/*
	The explanation following is for analyses with different maximum formant frequencies (i.e. different ceilings).
	The <name>-log tier can have multiple intervals. Each interval shows a particular analysis prefered by the user. It shows first the <ceiling> that was selected by the user, then a ';' separator and finally the number of parameters per track of the formant modeler. 
	Its content could be, for example '5000; 5 5 5', which means that the analysis with a ceiling of 5000 Hz was chosen and the Formant modeler used F1, F2, and F3 in the modelling and reserved 5 coefficients to model F1, 5 coefficients to model F2 and 5 coefficients to model F3. The <ceiling> number must match one of the possible ceilings (rounded to integer Hz values)
	An empty interval always implies the default analysis. Therefore only intervals where you want a non-default have to be specified.

	There is no need to permanently store the FormantModelers because they can easily
	be calculated whenever they are needed from the information in the tiers.
	
	Multichannel sounds don't make sense with respect to the analysis part. If both channels are the same sound, one is redundant.
	If two different sounds, then average (convert to mono), as in other editors.
