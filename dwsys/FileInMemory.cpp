	Notice that stream's internal position indicator may point to the end-of-file for the next operation,

	This indicator is cleared by a call to clearerr, rewind, fseek, fsetpos or freopen.

	Parameters

	int fseek ( FILE * stream, long int offset, int origin );

	Reposition stream position indicator
	Sets the position indicator associated with the stream to a new position.

	For streams open in binary mode, the new position is defined by adding offset to a reference position specified by origin.

	For streams open in text mode, offset shall either be zero or a value returned by a previous call to ftell,
	and origin shall necessarily be SEEK_SET.

	If the function is called with other values for these arguments,
	support depends on the particular system and library implementation (non-portable).

	The end-of-file internal indicator of the stream is cleared after a successful call to this function,
	and all effects from previous calls to ungetc on this stream are dropped.

	On streams open for update (read+write), a call to fseek allows to switch between reading and writing.

	Parameters

	stream
		Pointer to a FILE object that identifies the stream.
	offset
		Binary files: Number of bytes to offset from origin.
		Text files: Either zero, or a value returned by ftell.
	origin
		Position used as reference for the offset. It is specified by one of the following constants defined in <cstdio> exclusively to be used as arguments for this function:
		Constant	Reference position
		SEEK_SET	Beginning of file
		SEEK_CUR	Current position of the file pointer
		SEEK_END	End of file *
		* Library implementations are allowed to not meaningfully support SEEK_END (therefore, code using it has no real standard portability).

	From http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio 20171028
	char * fgets ( char * str, int num, FILE * stream );

	Get string from stream
	Reads characters from stream and stores them as a C string into str until (num-1) characters have been read
	or either a newline or the end-of-file is reached, whichever happens first.

	A newline character makes fgets stop reading,
	but it is considered a valid character by the function and included in the string copied to str.

	A terminating null character is automatically appended after the characters copied to str.

	Notice that fgets is quite different from gets: not only fgets accepts a stream argument,
	but also allows to specify the maximum size of str and includes in the string any ending newline character.

	Parameters

	str
		Pointer to an array of chars where the string read is copied.
	num
		Maximum number of characters to be copied into str (including the terminating null-character).
	stream
		Pointer to a FILE object that identifies an input stream.
		stdin can be used as argument to read from the standard input.


	Return Value
	On success, the function returns str.
	If the end-of-file is encountered while attempting to read a character, the eof indicator is set (feof).
	If this happens before any characters could be read, the pointer returned is a null pointer (and the contents of str remain unchanged).

	int ungetc ( int character, FILE * stream );

	Unget character from stream
	A character is virtually put back into an input stream, decreasing its internal file position as if a previous getc operation was undone.

	This character may or may not be the one read from the stream in the preceding input operation. In any case, the next character retrieved from stream is the character passed to this function, independently of the original one.

	Notice though, that this only affects further input operations on that stream, and not the content of the physical file associated with it, which is not modified by any calls to this function.

	Some library implementations may support this function to be called multiple times, making the characters available in the reverse order in which they were put back. Although this behavior has no standard portability guarantees, and further calls may simply fail after any number of calls beyond the first.

	If successful, the function clears the end-of-file indicator of stream (if it was currently set), and decrements its internal file position indicator if it operates in binary mode; In text mode, the position indicator has unspecified value until all characters put back with ungetc have been read or discarded.

	A call to fseek, fsetpos or rewind on stream will discard any characters previously put back into it with this function.

	If the argument passed for the character parameter is EOF, the operation fails and the input stream remains unchanged.

	Parameters

	character
		The int promotion of the character to be put back.
		The value is internally converted to an unsigned char when put back.
	stream
		Pointer to a FILE object that identifies an input stream.


	Return Value
	On success, the character put back is returned.
	If the operation fails, EOF is returned.
