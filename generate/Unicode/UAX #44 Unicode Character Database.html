    <p><i><b>Note:</b> the information in 
    this annex is not intended as an exhaustive description of the use and 
    interpretation of Unicode character properties and behavior. It must be used in conjunction with 
    the data in the other files in the Unicode Character Database, and relies on the notation and 
    definitions supplied in <a href="https://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html">The Unicode 
    Standard</a>. All chapter references are to Version 
    14.0.0 of the standard unless otherwise indicated.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2>1 <a name="Introduction" href="#Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
  
  <p>The Unicode Standard is far more than a simple encoding of characters.
  The standard also associates a rich set of semantics with each encoded
  character&#x2014;properties that
  are required for interoperability and correct behavior in
  implementations, as well as for Unicode conformance. 
  These semantics are cataloged in the Unicode Character Database (UCD), a collection of data files 
  which contain the Unicode character code points and character names. 
  The data files define the Unicode character properties and mappings between 
  Unicode characters (such as case mappings).</p>
  
  <p>This annex describes the UCD and provides a guide to the various 
  documentation files associated with it. Additional information
  about character properties and their use is contained in the
  Unicode Standard and its annexes. In particular, implementers should familiarize themselves
  with the formal definitions and conformance requirements for properties detailed
  in <i>Section 3.5, Properties</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
  and with the material in <i>Chapter 4, Character Properties</i> in 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]. 
  Additional discussion about the Unicode
  character property model can be found in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UTR23">UTR23</a>].</p>
  
  <p>The latest version of the UCD is always located on the Unicode 
  website at:</p>

 <h2>2 <a name="Conformance" href="#Conformance">Conformance</a></h2>
 
 <p>The Unicode Character Database is an integral part of the Unicode Standard.</p>
 
<p>The UCD contains normative property and mapping information required for 
implementation of various Unicode algorithms such as the Unicode Bidirectional 
Algorithm, Unicode Normalization, and Unicode Casefolding. The data files also 
contain additional informative and provisional character property information.</p>

<p>Each specification of a Unicode algorithm, whether specified in the text of 
[<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] or in one of the Unicode 
Standard Annexes, designates which data file(s) in the UCD are needed to 
provide normative property information required by that algorithm.</p>

<p>For information on the meaning and application of the terms, 
<i>normative</i>, <i>informative</i>, <i>contributory</i>, and <i>provisional</i>, see <i>Section 3.5, 
Properties</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>

<p>For information about the applicable terms of use for the
UCD, see the Unicode <a href="https://www.unicode.org/copyright.html">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

<h3>2.1 <a name="Simple_Derived" href="#Simple_Derived">Simple and Derived Properties</a></h3>

<h4>2.1.1 <a name="Simple_Props" href="#Simple_Props">Simple Properties</a></h4>

<p>Some character properties in the UCD are simple properties.
This status has no bearing on whether or not the properties are
normative, but merely indicates that their values
are not derived from some combination of other properties.</p>

<h4>2.1.2 <a name="Derived_Props" href="#Derived_Props">Derived Properties</a></h4>

<p>Other character properties are derived. This means that
their values are derived by rule from some other
combination of properties. Generally such rules are
stated as set operations, and may or may not include
explicit exception lists for individual characters.</p>

<p>Certain simple properties are defined merely
to make the statement of the rule defining a derived
property more compact or general. Such properties are
known as <a href="#Contributory_Properties">contributory properties</a>.
Sometimes these contributory properties are defined to
encapsulate the messiness inherent in exception
lists. At other times, a contributory property may
be defined to help stabilize the definition of
an important derived property which is subject to stability
guarantees.</p>

<p>Derived character properties are not considered
second-class citizens among Unicode character properties.
They are defined to make implementation of important
algorithms easier to state. Included among the
first-class derived properties important for such
implementations are: Uppercase, Lowercase, XID_Start,
XID_Continue, Math, and Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, all
defined in DerivedCoreProperties.txt, as well as derived
properties for the optimization of normalization, defined
in DerivedNormalizationProps.txt.</p>

<p>Implementations should simply use the derived properties,
and should not try to rederive them from lists of simple
properties and collections of rules, because of the
chances for error and divergence when doing so.</p>

<p>Definitions of property derivations are provided
for information only, typically in comment fields
in the data files. Such definitions may be refactored,
refined, or corrected over time. These
definitions are presented in a modified set notation, expressed
as set additions and/or subtractions of various other property
values. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
# Derived Property: ID_Start
#  Characters that can start an identifier.
#  Generated from:
#      Lu + Ll + Lt + Lm + Lo + Nl
#    + Other_ID_Start
#    - Pattern_Syntax
#    - Pattern_White_Space
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>When interpreting definitions of derived properties
of this sort, keep in mind that set subtraction is not a commutative
operation. Thus "Lo + Lm - Pattern_Syntax" defines a different set
than "Lo - Pattern_Syntax + Lm". The order of property set operations
stated in the definitions affects the composition of
the derived set.</p>

<p>If there are any cases of mismatches
between the definition of a derived property as
listed in DerivedCoreProperties.txt or similar data
files in the UCD, and the definition of a derived
property as a set definition rule, the explicit
listing in the data file should <i>always</i> be taken
as the normative definition of the property. As described
in <a href="#Release_Stability">Stability of Releases</a> the property
listing in the data files for any given version
of the standard  will never change for that version.</p>

<h4>2.1.3 <a name="Props_External" href="#Props_External">Properties Dependent on External Specifications</a></h4>

<p>In limited cases, a Unicode character property defined in the Unicode Character Database
may have an external dependency on another specification which is not a part of the Unicode Standard,
and whose data is not formally part of the UCD. In such cases, version stabiity for the UCD is attained by
requiring that dependency to be based on a known, published version of the external specification.</p>

<p>Starting with Version 10.0 of the UCD and continuing through Version 12.1, 
  the clear example of such an external dependency was the
  derivation of some segmentation-related character properties, in part based on emoji properties associated with
  UTS #51, "Unicode Emoji" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UTS51">UTS51</a>]. The details of the
  derivation were described in the respective annexes, [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX14">UAX14</a>]
  and [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX29">UAX29</a>], as well as in the documentation portions of
  the associated UCD property files. See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Data14">Data14</a>]
  and [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Props0">Props</a>].
  The version of UTS #51 used for those segmentation properties 
  in each of the relevant versions of the UCD was clearly
  identified in those annexes and data files. Starting with
  Version 13.0 of the UCD, however, the emoji properties which the UCD previously
  depended on have been formally incorporated
  into the UCD, so that they no longer constitute an external dependency.</p>

<p>An external dependency may impact either a simple or a derived property.</p>

<h3>2.2 <a name="Use_Default" href="#Use_Default">Use of Default Values</a></h3>

<p>Unicode character properties have default values. Default
values are the value or values that a character property takes
for an unassigned code point, or in some instances, for
designated subranges of code points, whether assigned or
unassigned. For example, the default value of a binary
Unicode character property is always "N".</p>

<p>For the formal discussion of default values, see D26 in
<i>Section 3.5, Properties</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].
For conventions related to default values in various data files
of the UCD and for documentation regarding the particular default values of
individual Unicode character properties, see <a href="#Default_Values">Default Values</a>.</p>

<h3>2.3 <a name="Release_Stability" href="#Release_Stability">Stability of Releases</a></h3>

<p>Just as for the Unicode Standard as a whole, each version of the
UCD, once published, is absolutely stable and will <i>never</i>
change. Each released version is archived in a directory on
the Unicode website, with a directory number associated with
that version. URLs pointing to that version's directory are also
stable and will be maintained in perpetuity.</p>

<p>Any errors discovered for a released version of the UCD
are noted in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Errata">Errata</a>],
and if appropriate will be corrected in a <i>subsequent</i>
version of the UCD.</p>

<p>Stability guarantees constraining how Unicode character
properties can (or cannot) change between releases of the UCD
are documented in the Unicode Consortium Stability
Policies [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Stability">Stability</a>].</p>

<h4>2.3.1 <a name="Allowed_Changes" href="#Allowed_Changes">Changes to Properties Between Releases</a></h4>

<p>Updates to character properties in the Unicode Character Database may be required
for any of three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>To cover new characters added to the standard</li>
<li>To add new character properties to the standard</li>
<li>To change the assigned values for a property for some characters already in the standard</li>
</ol>

<p>While the Unicode Consortium endeavors to keep the values of all
character properties as stable as possible between versions, occasionally circumstances
may arise which require changing them. In particular, as less well-documented scripts, such
as those for minority languages, or historic scripts are added to the standard, the exact
character properties and behavior may not fully be known when the script is first encoded.
The properties for some of these characters may change as further information becomes
available or as implementations turn up problems in the initial property assignments.
As far as possible, any readjustment of property values based
on growing implementation experience is made to be compatible with established practice.</p>

<p>All changes to normative or informative property values, to the status
or type of a property, or to property or property value aliases, must be approved by
an explicit decision taken by the Unicode Technical Committee. Changes to provisional
property values are subject to less stringent oversight.</p>

<p>Occasionally, a character property value is changed to prevent incorrect generalizations
about a character's use based on its nominal property values. For example, U+200B ZERO
WIDTH SPACE was originally classified as a space character (General_Category=Zs), but
it was reclassified as a Format character (General_Category=Cf) to clearly distinguish it from space characters
in its function as a format control for line breaking.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that a particular value for an enumerated
property will actually have characters associated with it. Also, because of
changes in property value assignments between versions of the standard, a
property value that once had characters associated with it may later have none.
Such conditions and changes are rare, but implementations must not
assume that all property values are associated with non-null
sets of characters. For example, currently the special Script property
value Katakana_Or_Hiragana has no characters associated with it.</p>

<h4>2.3.2 <a name="Obsolete_Properties" href="#Obsolete_Properties">Obsolete Properties</a></h4>

<p>In some instances an entire property may become <i>obsolete</i>.
For example, the <a href="#ISO_Comment">ISO_Comment</a> property was once used to keep
track of annotations for characters used in the production of name lists for
ISO/IEC 10646 code charts. As of Unicode 5.2.0 that property became obsolete, 
and its value is now defaulted to the null string for all Unicode code points.</p>

<p>An obsolete property is never removed from the UCD.</p>

<h4>2.3.3 <a name="Deprecated_Properties" href="#Deprecated_Properties">Deprecated Properties</a></h4>

<p>Occasionally an obsolete property may also be formally
<i>deprecated</i>. This is an indication that the property is no longer recommended for
use, perhaps because its original intent has been replaced by another property
or because its specification was somehow defective. See also the
general discussion of <a href="#Deprecation">Deprecation</a>.</p>

<p>A deprecated property is never removed from the UCD.</p>

<p><i>Table 1</i> lists the properties that are formally deprecated as of
this version of the Unicode Standard.</p>

<h4>2.3.4 <a name="Stabilized_Properties" href="#Stabilized_Properties">Stabilized Properties</a></h4>

<p>Another possibility is that an obsolete property may be
declared to be <i>stabilized</i>. Such a determination does not indicate that
the property should or should not be used; instead it is a declaration that the
UTC (Unicode Technical Committee) will no longer actively maintain the property or extend it for newly
encoded characters. The property values of a
stabilized property are frozen as of a particular release of the standard.</p>

<p>A stabilized property is never removed from the UCD.</p>

<h2>3 <a name="Documentation_Files" href="#Documentation_Files">Documentation</a></h2>

<p>This annex provides the core documentation for the UCD, but
additional information about character properties is available in
other parts of the standard and in additional documentation files
contained within the UCD.</p>

<h3>3.1 <a name="Character_Properties" href="#Character_Properties">Character Properties in the Standard</a></h3>

  <p>The formal definitions related to character properties used
  by the Unicode Standard are documented in 
  <i>Section 3.5, Properties</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].
  Understanding those definitions and related terminology is
  essential to the appropriate use of Unicode character properties.</p>

  <p>See <i>Section 4.1, Unicode Character Database</i>, in 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for a general 
  discussion of the UCD and its use in defining properties. The
  rest of Chapter 4 provides important explanations regarding
  the meaning and use of various normative character properties.</p>

<h3>3.2 <a name="Property_Model" href="#Property_Model">The Character Property Model</a></h3>

  <p>For a general discussion of the property model which underlies
  the definitions associated with the UCD, see 
  Unicode Technical Report #23, "The Unicode Character Property Model" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UTR23">UTR23</a>].
  That technical report is informative, but over the years various
  content from it has been incorporated into normative portions
  of the Unicode Standard, particularly for the definitions in
  Chapter 3.</p>
  
  <p>UTR #23 presents the important distinction 
    between properties defined for strings (in contrast to properties defined for
    characters or code points) and character properties that have values that are strings.
    The latter are referred to as <i>string-valued properties</i> in UTR #23
    and in this annex. UTR #23 also discusses string functions and their relation to
  character properties.</p>

<h3>3.3 <a name="NamesList" href="#NamesList">NamesList.html</a></h3>

<p>NamesList.html formally describes the format of the NamesList.txt data file in BNF.
That data file is used to drive the PDF formatting
of the Unicode code charts and names list. See also <i>Section 24.1, 
Character Names List</i>, in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] 
for a detailed discussion of the conventions used in the Unicode names list as
formatted for the online code charts.</p>

<h3>3.4 <a name="StandardizedVariants" href="#StandardizedVariants">StandardizedVariants.html</a></h3>

<p>StandardizedVariants.html has been obsoleted
  as of Version 9.0 of the UCD. This file formerly 
  documented standardized variants, showing a 
representative glyph for each. It was closely tied to the data file, 
StandardizedVariants.txt, which defines those sequences normatively.</p>

<p>The function of StandardizedVariants.html to show representative
glyphs for standardized variants has been superseded. There are now better means
of illustrating the glyphs. Many standardized variation sequences are shown
in the Unicode code charts directly, in summary sections at the ends of the
names list for any block which contains them. Glyphs for standardized variants
of CJK compatibility ideographs are also shown directly in the Unicode
code charts.</p>

<h3>3.5 <a name="EmojiVariants" href="#EmojiVariants">Emoji Variation Sequences</a></h3>

<p>Emoji variation sequences are a special class of variation
sequences involving emoji characters. They are divided into two subtypes:
an <i>emoji presentation sequence</i>, consisting of an emoji character base followed
by the variation selector U+FE0F, and a <i>text presentation sequence</i>,
consisting of an emoji character base followed by the variation selector U+FE0E.
Such sequences come in pairs: the text presentation sequence shown
with a black and white presentation, as seen in the Unicode code charts,
and the emoji presentation sequence shown with a colorful icon, as
usually seen in implementations on mobile devices and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Starting with Version 9.0.0, the following page in the Unicode emoji
subsite area shows appropriate representative glyphs for all emoji variation 
sequences, with separate columns for text
presentation sequences and for emoji presentation sequences:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-variants.html">https://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-variants.html</a></p>

<p>The data file which defines the exact list of emoji variation
sequences is emoji-variation-sequences.txt. That file is maintained in the
UCD, but emoji variation sequences are documented in 
Unicode Technical Standard #51, <i>Unicode Emoji</i> 
[<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UTS51">UTS51</a>].</p>

<h3>3.6 <a name="Unihan" href="#Unihan">Unihan and UAX #38</a></h3>

<p>Unicode Standard Annex #38, "Unicode Han Database (Unihan)" 
[<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>] describes 
the format and content of the Unihan Database [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unihan">Unihan</a>], 
which collects together all property information 
for CJK unified ideographs. That annex also specifies in detail
which of the Unihan character properties are normative,
informative, or provisional.</p>

<p>The Unihan Database contains extensive and detailed mapping 
information for CJK unified ideographs encoded in the Unicode Standard, 
but it is aimed <i>only</i> at those ideographs, not at other characters used in the East 
Asian context in general.
In contrast, East Asian legacy character sets, including important 
commercial and national character set standards, contain many non-CJK 
characters. As a result, the Unihan Database must be supplemented from 
other sources to establish mapping tables for those character sets.</p>

<p>The majority of the content of the Unihan Database is
released for each version of the Unicode Standard as a collection of Unihan data
files in the UCD. Because of their large size, these data files are released only as
a zipped file, Unihan.zip. The details of the particular data files in Unihan.zip
and the CJK properties each one contains are provided in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>].
For versions of the UCD prior to Version 5.2.0, all of the CJK properties were
listed together in a very large, single file, Unihan.txt.</p>

<h3>3.7 <a name="USource" href="#USource">UTC-Source Ideographs and UAX #45</a></h3>

<p>Unicode Standard Annex #45, "U-Source Ideographs" 
[<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX45">UAX45</a>] describes the format of USourceData.txt,
which lists all of the information for UTC-Source ideographs.</p>

<h3>3.8 <a name="Data_File_Comments" href="#Data_File_Comments">Data File Comments</a></h3>

<p>In addition to the specific documentation files for the UCD, individual data 
files often contain extensive header comments describing their content and any 
special conventions used in the data.</p>

<p>In some instances, individual property 
definition sections also contain comments with information about how the property 
may be derived. Such comments are informative; while they are intended
to convey the intent of the derivation, in case of any mismatch between
a statement of a derivation in a comment field and the actual
listing of the derived property, the list is considered to be definitive.
See <a href="#Simple_Derived">Simple and Derived Properties</a>.</p>

<h3>3.9 <a name="Obsolete" href="#Obsolete">Obsolete Documentation Files</a></h3>

<p>UCD.html was formerly the primary documentation file for the UCD. As of Version 5.2.0, its
content has been wholly incorporated into this document.</p>

<p>Unihan.html was formerly the primary documentation file for 
the Unihan Database. As of Version 5.1.0, its
content has been wholly incorporated into [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>].</p>

<p>Versions of the Unicode Standard 
prior to Version 4.0.0 contained small, focused
documentation files, UnicodeCharacterDatabase.html, PropList.html, and
DerivedProperties.html, which were later consolidated into UCD.html.</p>

<p>StandardizedVariants.html has been obsoleted as of Version 9.0.0.
See <i>Section 3.4, <a href="#StandardizedVariants">StandardizedVariants.html</a></i>.</p>

<h2>4 <a name="UCD_Files" href="#UCD_Files">UCD Files</a></h2>
  
  <p>The heart of the UCD consists of the data files themselves. This section
  describes the directory structure for the UCD, the format conventions
  for the data files, and provides documentation for data files not documented
  elsewhere in this annex.</p>

<h3>4.1 <a name="Directory_Structure" href="#Directory_Structure">Directory Structure</a></h3>

  <p>Each version of the UCD is released in a separate, numbered directory
  under the <i>Public</i> directory on the Unicode website. The content of that
  directory is complete for that release. It is also stable&#x2014;once released,
  it will be archived permanently in that directory, unchanged, at a stable URL.</p>
  
  <p>The specific files for the UCD associated with this version of 
  the Unicode Standard (14.0.0) are located at:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/14.0.0/">https://www.unicode.org/Public/14.0.0/</a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The latest released version of the UCD is always accessible via the
  following stable URL:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/">https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/</a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Zipped copies of the latest released version of the UCD are always accessible via the
  following stable URL:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/zipped/latest/">https://www.unicode.org/Public/zipped/latest/</a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Prior to Version 6.3.0, access to the latest released version
  of the UCD was via the following stable URL:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/">https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/</a>
  </blockquote>

  <p>That "UNIDATA" URL will be maintained, but is no longer recommended, because
  it points to the <i>ucd</i> subdirectory of the latest release, rather than to the parent
  directory for the release. The "UNIDATA" naming convention is also very old, and does not follow
  the directory naming conventions currently used for other data releases in the
  <i>Public</i> directory on the Unicode website.</p>


<h4>4.1.1 <a name="UCD_Proper" href="#UCD_Proper">UCD Files Proper</a></h4>

  <p>The UCD proper is located in the <i>ucd</i> subdirectory of the numbered version
  directory. That directory contains all of the documentation files and most
  of the data files for the UCD, including some data files for derived properties.</p>
  
  <p>Although all UCD data files are version-specific for a release and most contain
  internal date and version stamps, the file names of the released data files do not
  differ from version to version. When linking to a version-specific data file, the
  version will be indicated by the version number of the directory for the release.</p>
  
  <p>All files for derived extracted properties are in the <i><b>extracted</b></i> 
	subdirectory of the <i>ucd</i> subdirectory. 
	See <a href="#Derived_Extracted">Derived Extracted Properties</a> for
	documentation regarding those data files and their content.</p> 

   <p>A number of auxiliary properties are specified in files in the <i><b>auxiliary</b></i>
	 subdirectory of the <i>ucd</i> subdirectory. It contains 
    data files specifying properties associated with 
    Unicode Standard Annex #29, "Unicode Text Segmentation" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX29">UAX29</a>]
    and with
    Unicode Standard Annex #14, "Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX14">UAX14</a>],
    as well as test data for those algorithms.
    See <a href="#Segmentation_Test_Files">Segmentation Test Files and Documentation</a>
    for more information about the test data.</p>

  <p>Certain data files associated with emoji properties are maintained
    in the <i><b>emoji</b></i> subdirectory of the <i>ucd</i> subdirectory. Those data
    files define the simple character properties associated with emoji characters,
    as well as the emoji variation sequences. Other data files associated with
    emoji, including those which define
    the RGI ("recommended for general interchange") sets of various
    types of emoji sequences, as well as emoji test data, are maintained elsewhere,
    and are not considered formally a part of the UCD.
    See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UTS51">UTS51</a>] for documentation regarding those data files and their content.</p>
	 
<h4>4.1.2 <a name="UCD_XML_Files" href="#UCD_XML_Files">UCD XML Files</a></h4>

  <p>The XML version of the UCD is located in the <i>ucdxml</i> subdirectory of the
  numbered version directory. See the <a href="#UCD_in_XML">UCD in XML</a> for
  more details.</p>

<h4>4.1.3 <a name="Chart_Files" href="#Chart_Files">Charts</a></h4>

  <p>The code charts specific to a version of Unicode are archived 
  as a single large PDF file in the <i>charts</i> subdirectory of the
  numbered version directory. See the readme.txt in that subdirectory
  and the general web page explaining the 
  <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/About.html">Unicode Code Charts</a> for
  more details.</p>
  
<h4>4.1.4 <a name="Beta_Review" href="#Beta_Review">Beta Review Considerations</a></h4>

  <p>Prior to the formal release for any particular version of the UCD, a beta
  review is conducted. The beta review files are located in the same directory
  that is later used for the released UCD, but during the beta review period,
  the subdirectory structure differs somewhat and may contain temporary files,
  including documentation of diffs between deltas for the beta review. Also,
  during the beta review, all data file names are suffixed with version
  numbers and delta numbers. So a typical file name during beta review
  may be "PropList-5.2.0d13.txt" instead of the finally released "PropList.txt".</p>
  
  <p>Notices contained in a ReadMe.txt file in the UCD directory during the
  beta review period also make it clear that that directory contains
  preliminary material under review, rather than a final, stable release.</p>
  
<h4>4.1.5 <a name="Directory_History" href="#Directory_History">File Directory Differences for Early Releases</a></h4>

  <p>The <a href="#UCD_in_XML">UCD in XML</a> was introduced in Version 5.1.0,
  so UCD directories prior to that do not contain the <i>ucdxml</i> subdirectory.</p>
  
  <p>UCD directories prior to Version 13.0.0 do not contain the <i>emoji</i>
  subdirectory.</p>
  
  <p>UCD directories prior to Version 4.1.0 do not contain the <i>auxiliary</i>
  subdirectory.</p>
  
  <p>UCD directories prior to Version 3.2.0 do not contain the <i>extracted</i>
  subdirectory.</p>
  
  <p>The general structure of the file directory for a released version of the UCD
  described above applies to Versions 4.1.0 and later. Prior to Version 4.1.0,
  versions of the UCD were not self-contained, complete sets of data files
  for that version, but instead only contained any new data files or any data files
  which had <i>changed</i> since the prior release.</p>
  
  <p>Because of this, the property files for a given version
  prior to Version 4.1.0 can be spread over several directories. Consult the
  component listings at
  <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/enumeratedversions.html">Enumerated Versions</a>
  to find out which files in which directories comprise a complete set of data
  files for that version.</p>

  <p>The directory naming conventions and the file naming conventions also
  differed prior to Version 4.1.0. So, for example, Version 4.0.0 of the UCD
  is contained in a directory named <i>4.0-Update</i>, and Version 4.0.1 of
  the UCD in a directory named <i>4.0-Update1</i>. Furthermore, for these
  earlier versions, the data file names <i>do</i> contain explicit version
  numbers.</p>
  	
<h3>4.2 <a name="Format_Conventions" href="#Format_Conventions">File Format Conventions</a></h3>

  <p>Files in the UCD use the format conventions described in
  this section, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<h4>4.2.1 <a name="Data_Fields" href="#Data_Fields">Data Fields</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Each line of data consists of fields separated by semicolons. The fields are numbered 
    starting with zero.</li>
    <li>The first field (0) of each line in the Unicode Character Database files represents a code 
    point or range. The remaining fields (1..n) are properties associated with that code point.</li>
    <li>Leading and trailing spaces within a field are not significant.
    However, no leading or trailing spaces
    are allowed in any field of UnicodeData.txt. For legacy reasons,
    no spaces are allowed before or after the semicolon in LineBreak.txt and in EastAsianWidth.txt.</li>
    <li>The Unihan data files [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unihan">Unihan</a>] in the UCD have a separate format, using tab characters
    instead of semicolons to separate fields. See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>]
    for the detailed specification of the format of the Unihan data files. The
    data files TangutSources.txt and NushuSources.txt also use this format.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>4.2.2 <a name="Code_Points" href="#Code_Points">Code Points and Sequences</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Code points are expressed as hexadecimal numbers with four to six digits.
    (See <i>Appendix A, Notational Conventions</i> in
    [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
    for a full, formal definition of this convention.) 
    They are written without the &quot;U+&quot; prefix in
    all data files except the Unihan data files. The Unihan data files use the &quot;U+&quot; prefix for
    all Unicode code points, to distinguish them from other decimal and hexadecimal
    numerical references occurring in their data fields.</li>
    <li>When a data field contains a sequence of code points, spaces separate
    the code points. 
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4>4.2.3 <a name="Code_Point_Ranges" href="#Code_Point_Ranges">Code Point Ranges</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>A range of code points is specified by the form &quot;X..Y&quot;.</li> 
    <li>Each code point in a range has the 
    associated property value specified on a data file. For example (from Blocks.txt):
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
0000..007F; Basic Latin
0080..00FF; Latin-1 Supplement
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>For backward compatibility, ranges in the file UnicodeData.txt 
    are specified by entries for the 
    start and end characters of the range, rather than by the form &quot;X..Y&quot;. 
    The start character is indicated by a range identifier, followed by a comma
    and the string &quot;First&quot;, in angle brackets. This entry takes the
    place of a regular character name in field 1 for that line.
    The end character is indicated on the next line with the same range identifier,
    followed by a comma and the string &quot;Last&quot;, in angle brackets:
 
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
4E00;&lt;CJK Ideograph, First&gt;;Lo;0;L;;;;;N;;;;;
9FEF;&lt;CJK Ideograph, Last&gt;;Lo;0;L;;;;;N;;;;;
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    For character ranges using this convention, the names of all characters in the range 
    are algorithmically derivable.  
    See <i>Section 4.8, Name</i> 
    in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for more information on 
    derivation of character names for such ranges.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>4.2.4 <a name="Comments" href="#Comments">Comments</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (&quot;#&quot;) is used to indicate comments: all 
    characters from the number sign to the end 
    of the line are considered part of the comment, and are disregarded when parsing data.</li>
    <li>In many files, the comments on data 
    lines use a common format, as illustrated here (from Scripts.txt):
    <blockquote>
       <pre>09B2          ; Bengali # Lo       BENGALI LETTER LA</pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>The first part of a comment using this common format is the General_Category value,
    provided for information. This is followed by the character name for
    the code point in the first field (0).</li>
    <li>The printing of the General_Category value is suppressed in instances where
    it would be redundant, as for DerivedGeneralCategory.txt, in which the value
    of the property value in the data field is already the General_Category value.</li>
    <li>The symbol &quot;L&amp;&quot; 
    indicates characters of General_Category Lu, Ll, or Lt (uppercase, lowercase,
    or titlecase letter). For example:
    <blockquote>
       <pre>0386          ; Greek # L&amp;       GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH TONOS</pre>
    </blockquote>
    L&amp; as used in these comments is an alias for
    the derived LC value (cased letter) for the General_Category property, as documented in 
    PropertyValueAliases.txt.</li>
    <li>When the data line contains a range of code points, this common format
    for a comment also indicates a range of character names, separated by &quot;..&quot;, as
    illustrated here (from DerivedNumericType.txt):
    <blockquote>
      <pre>00BC..00BE    ; Numeric # No   [3] VULGAR FRACTION ONE QUARTER..VULGAR FRACTION THREE QUARTERS</pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>Normally, consecutive characters with the same property value would be 
    represented by a single code point range. In data files using this 
    comment convention, such ranges are subdivided so that all 
    characters in a range also 
    have the same General_Category value (or LC).
    While this convention results in more ranges than are strictly necessary, it 
    makes the contents of the ranges clearer.</li>
    <li>When a code point range occurs, the number of items in the range is
    included in the comment (in square brackets), immediately following the General_Category value.</li>
    <li>The comments are purely informational, and may change format or be omitted in the 
    future. They should not be parsed for content.</li>
   </ul>
   
<h4>4.2.5 <a name="Code_Point_Labels" href="#Code_Point_Labels">Code Point Labels</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Surrogate code points, private-use characters, control codes, noncharacters,
    and unassigned code points have no names. When such code points are
    listed in the data files, for example to list their General_Category
    values, the comments use code point labels instead of character
    names. For example (from DerivedCoreProperties.txt):
    <blockquote>
      <pre>2065          ; Default_Ignorable_Code_Point # Cn       &lt;reserved-2065&gt;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>Although code point labels are not formally character names
      and are not considered values of the Name property for characters, they are
      designed to be maintained as unique values within the namespace for Unicode
      character names. Hence, implementations can safely use them as identifiers
      for code points without overlap with actual character names.</li>
    <li>Code point labels use one of the tags as documented in
    <i>Section 4.8, Name</i> 
    in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] and as shown in <i>Table 3</i>, 
    followed by &quot;-&quot; and the code point expressed in hexadecimal. The
    entire label is then enclosed in angle brackets when
    listed in data files of the UCD.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="caption">Table 3. <a name="Label_Tags_Table" href="#Label_Tags_Table">Code Point Label Tags</a></p>

<h4>4.2.6 <a name="Multiple_Properties" href="#Multiple_Properties">Multiple Properties in One Data File</a></h4>

  <ul>
   <li>When a file contains the specification for multiple properties, the second field specifies the name 
    of the property and the third field specifies the property value. For example (from
    DerivedNormalizationProps.txt):
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
03D2  ; FC_NFKC; 03C5           # L&amp;  GREEK UPSILON WITH HOOK SYMBOL
03D3  ; FC_NFKC; 03CD           # L&amp;  GREEK UPSILON WITH ACUTE AND HOOK SYMBOL
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4>4.2.7 <a name="Binary_Values" href="#Binary_Values">Binary Property Values</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>For binary properties, the second field specifies the name of the applicable property, with 
    the implied value of the property being &quot;True&quot;. Only the ranges of characters with the binary 
    property value of &quot;Y&quot; (= True) are listed. For example (from PropList.txt):
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
1680       ; White_Space # Zs      OGHAM SPACE MARK
2000..200A ; White_Space # Zs [11] EN QUAD..HAIR SPACE
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4>4.2.8 <a name="Multiple_Values" href="#Multiple_Values">Multiple Values for Properties</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>When a data file defines a property which may take multiple values for a single code
    point, the multiple values are expressed in a space-delimited list. For example (from ScriptExtensions.txt):

    <li>In some cases&#x2014;but not all&#x2014;the order of multiple elements in a space-delimited
    list may be significant. When the order of multiple elements is significant, it is documented
    along with the property itself. For example (from Unihan_Readings.txt), for the tag kMandarin,
    when there are two values for a code point, the first value is used to
    indicate a preferred pronunciation for zh-Hans (CN) and the second a
    preferred pronunciation for zh-Hant (TW).

  <ul>
    <li>Entries for a code point may be omitted in a data file if the 
    code point has a default value for the property in question.</li>
    
    <li>For string properties, 
    including the definition of foldings, the 
    default value is the code point of the character itself.</li>
    
    <li>For miscellaneous properties which take strings as values,
    such as the Unicode Name property, the default value is a null
    string.</li>
    
    <li>For binary properties except for <a href="#Extended_Pictographic">Extended_Pictographic</a>, 
      the default value is always &quot;N&quot; (= False)
    and is always omitted.</li>
    
    <li>For enumerated and catalog properties, the default value is listed in a comment. For 
    example (from Scripts.txt):
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
#  All code points not explicitly listed for Script
#  have the value Unknown (Zzzz).
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
    
    <li>A few properties of the enumerated type have multiple default values. In
    those cases, comments in the file explain the code point ranges for applicable values.
    See also <a href="#Default_Values_Table"><i>Table 4</i></a>.</li>
    
    <li>Default values are also listed in specially-formatted comment lines,
    using the keyword &quot;@missing&quot;. Parsers which extract and process
    these lines can algorithmically determine the default values for all code points. 
    See <a href="#Missing_Conventions">@missing Conventions</a>
    for details about the syntax and use of these lines.
    </li>
    
    <li>Because of the legacy format constraints for UnicodeData.txt, that
    file contains no specific information about default values for properties.
    The default values for fields in UnicodeData.txt are documented 
    in <a href="#Default_Values_Table"><i>Table 4</i></a> below
    if they cannot be derived from the general rules about default values
    for properties.</li>
    
    <li>The file ArabicShaping.txt is also exceptional, because it omits the listing
    of many characters whose property value (jt=T) can be derived by rule. Adding an &quot;@missing&quot; line
    to that file would result in the wrong interpretation of Joining_Type values for omitted characters.
    The full explicit listing of Joining_Type values and the correct &quot;@missing&quot; line for
    the default Joining_Type value (jt=U) can be found in the file DerivedJoiningType.txt instead.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Default values for common catalog, enumeration, and
  numeric properties are listed in <i>Table 4</i>, along
  with the exceptional binary property, Extended_Pictographic.

    those cases where the default values
  are complex, as indicated in the third column.</p>

<h4>4.2.9.1 <a name="Complex_Default_Values" href="#Complex_Default_Values">Complex Default Values</a></h4>

  <p><i>Complex default values</i> are those which take multiple values, contingent on
  code point ranges or other conditions. Complex default values other than those specified in the
  &quot;@missing&quot; line are explicitly listed in the relevant property file, except for instances
  noted in this section. This means that a parser extracting property values from
  the UCD should never encounter an ambiguous condition for which the default value of a property
  for a particular code point is unclear.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#Bidi_Class">Bidi_Class</a>:<br> See  
  Unicode Standard Annex #9, "Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX9">UAX9</a>]

    <li><a href="#East_Asian_Width">East_Asian_Width</a>:<br> This property defaults to Neutral for most code points, but defaults to Wide

  See Unicode Standard Annex #11, "East Asian Width"

  EastAsianWidth.txt for documentation of the default values
    and DerivedEastAsianWidth.txt for the full listing of values.</li>
    <li><a href="#Line_Break">Line_Break</a>:<br> This property defaults to Unknown for most code points, but defaults to ID
  for unassigned code points in blocks associated with CJK ideographs, and 
  in blocks in the ranges U+1F000..U+1FAFF
  and U+1FC00..U+1FFFD. 
  The property defaults to PR for unassigned code
  points in the Currency Symbols block. See Unicode Standard Annex #14, "Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm"
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX14">UAX14</a>]

    Those ranges are correlated with the ranges associated with default values for the Line_Break
    property, and have the same rationale. They help future-proof the behavior of Unicode segmentation
    algorithms for code point ranges most likely to be used for future assignment of new emoji characters.</li>

<h4>4.2.10 <a name="Missing_Conventions" href="#Missing_Conventions">@missing Conventions</a></h4>

<p>Specially-formatted comment lines with the keyword "@missing" are
used to define default property values for ranges of code points not explicitly listed
in a data file. These lines follow regular conventions that make them
machine-readable.</p>

<p>An @missing line starts with the comment character "#", followed by
a space, then the "@missing" keyword, followed by a colon, another space, a code
point range, and a semicolon. Then the
line typically continues with a semicolon-delimited list of one or more
default property values. For example:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
# @missing: 0000..10FFFF; Unknown
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

<p>In general, the code point range and semicolon-delimited list follow
the same syntactic conventions as the data file in which the @missing line occurs, so
that any parser which interprets that data file can easily be adapted to also
parse and interpret an @missing line to pick up default property values for code points.</p>

<p>@missing lines are also supplied for many properties in the file
PropertyValueAliases.txt. In this case, because there are many @missing lines in that
single data file, each @missing line contains an additional second field specifying the
property name for which it defines a default value.</p>

<p>An @missing line is never provided for a binary property, because the
default value for binary properties is always "N" and need not be defined redundantly
for each binary property.</p>

<p>Because of the
addition of property names when @missing lines are included in PropertyValueAliases.txt,
there are currently two syntactic patterns used for @missing lines, as
summarized schematically below:</p>

<ol>
<li>code_point_range; default_prop_val</li>
<li>code_point_range; property_name; default_prop_val</li>
</ol>

<p>In this schematic representation, "default_prop_val" stands in for
either an explicit property value or for a special tag such as &lt;none&gt; or
&lt;script&gt;.</p>

<p>Pattern #1 is used in most primary and derived UCD files. For example:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
# @missing: 0000..10FFFF; &lt;none&gt;
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

<p>Pattern #2 is used in PropertyValueAliases.txt and in
DerivedNormalizationProps.txt, both of which contain values associated with many
properties. For example:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
# @missing: 0000..10FFFF; NFD_QC; Yes
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

<p>The special tag values which may occur in the default_prop_val field
in an @missing line are interpreted as follows:</p>

<div align="center">

<table class="simple">
  <tr>
    <th>Tag</th>
    <th>Interpretation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;none&gt;</td>
    <td>the empty string</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;code point&gt;</td>
    <td>the string representation of the code point value</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;script&gt;</td>
    <td>the value equal to the Script property value for this code point</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>4.2.11 <a name="Empty_Fields" href="#Empty_Fields">Empty Fields</a></h4>

<p>The data file UnicodeData.txt defines many property values in each record. When a
field in a data line for a code point is empty, that indicates that the property takes
the default value for that code point. For example:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
0022;QUOTATION MARK;Po;0;ON;;;;;N;;;;;
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    
<p>In that data line, the empty numeric fields indicate that the value of Numeric_Value for
U+0022 is NaN and that the value of Numeric_Type is None. The empty case mapping fields indicate
that the value of Simple_Uppercase_Mapping for U+0022 takes the default value, namely the
code point itself, and so forth.</p>

<p>The interpretation of empty fields in other data files of the UCD differs. In the
case of data files which define string-valued properties, 
the omission of an entry for a code point
indicates that the property takes the default value for that code point. However, if there
is an entry for a code point, but the property value field for that entry is empty, that
indicates that the property value is an explicit empty string (""). For example, the derived 
property <a href="#NFKC_Casefold">NFKC_Casefold</a> may map a code point to a sequence of code points, to a single different code
point, to the same single code point, or to no code point at all (an empty string). See the following entries from
the data file DerivedNormalizationProps.txt:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
00AA          ; NFKC_CF; 0061           # Lo       FEMININE ORDINAL INDICATOR
00AD          ; NFKC_CF;                # Cf       SOFT HYPHEN
00AF          ; NFKC_CF; 0020 0304      # Sk       MACRON
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    
<p>The empty field for U+00AD indicates that the property NFKC_Casefold maps SOFT HYPHEN
to an empty string. By contrast, the absence of the entry for U+00AE in the data file indicates
that the property NFKC_Casefold maps U+00AE REGISTERED SIGN to itself&#x2014;the default value.</p>

    
<h4>4.2.12 <a name="Text_Encoding" href="#Text_Encoding">Text Encoding</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>The data files use UTF-8. Unless otherwise noted, non-ASCII characters only 
    appear in comments.</li>
    <li>The Unihan data files [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unihan">Unihan</a>] in the UCD make extensive use of UTF-8 in data fields.
    (See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>] for details.)</li>
    <li>For legacy reasons, NamesList.txt was exceptional; it was encoded 
    in Latin-1 prior to Unicode 6.2. For
    Unicode 6.2 and later, the encoding is UTF-8. See <a href="#NamesList">NamesList.html</a>.</li>
    <li>Segmentation test data files, such as WordBreakTest.txt, make
    use of non-ASCII (UTF-8) characters as delimiters for data fields.</li>
  </ul>
    
<h4>4.2.13 <a name="Line_Termination" href="#Line_Termination">Line Termination</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>All data files in the UCD use LF line termination (not CRLF line termination). 
    When copied to different systems, these line endings may be automatically changed to
    use the native line termination conventions for that system. Make sure your editor (or parser) can 
    deal with the line termination 
    style in the local copy of the data files.</li>
  </ul>
    
<h4>4.2.14 <a name="Other_Conventions" href="#Other_Conventions">Other Conventions</a></h4>

  <ul>
    <li>In some test data files, segments of the test data are distinguished by a line 
    starting with an &quot;@&quot; sign. For example (from NormalizationTest.txt):
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
@Part1 # Character by character test
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h4>4.2.15 <a name="Other_File_Formats" href="#Other_File_Formats">Other File Formats</a></h4>

  <ul>    
    <li>The data format for Unihan data files and for
    TangutSources.txt and NushuSources.txt
    in the UCD differs from the standard format. 
	See the discussion of <a href="#Unihan">Unihan and UAX #38</a> 
	earlier in this annex for more information.</li>
    <li>The format for NamesList.txt, which documents the Unicode names
    list and which is used programmatically to drive the formatting
    program for Unicode code charts, also differs significantly from regular UCD data files.
    See <a href="#NamesList">NamesList.html</a></li>
    <li>Index.txt is another exception. It uses a tab-delimited format, with field 0
    consisting of an index entry string, and field 1 a code point. Index.txt is used to
    maintain the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/charindex.html">
    Unicode Character Name Index</a>.</li>
    <li>The various segmentation test data files make use of &quot;#&quot; to delimit comments,
    but have distinct conventions for their data fields. See the documentation
    in their header sections for details of the data field formats for
    those files.</li>
    <li>The XML version of the UCD has its own file format conventions.
    In those files, "#" is used to stand for the code point in
    algorithmically derivable character names such as CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E00
    or TANGUT IDEOGRAPH-17000,
    so as to allow for name sharing in more compact representations of the data.
    See Unicode Standard Annex #42, "Unicode Character Database in XML" 
    [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX42">UAX42</a>] for details.</li>  
  </ul>

<h3>4.3 <a name="File_List" href="#File_List">File List</a></h3>

  <p>The exact list of files associated with any particular version of the UCD is
  available on the Unicode website by referring to the component listings at
  <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/enumeratedversions.html">Enumerated Versions</a>.</p>
  
  <p>The majority of the data files in the UCD provide specifications of
  character properties for Unicode characters. Those files and their contents
  are documented in detail in the <a href="#Property_Definitions">Property Definitions</a> section
  below.</p>
  
  <p>The data files in the <i>extracted</i> subdirectory constitute reformatted listings
  of single character properties extracted from UnicodeData.txt or other primary
  data files. The reformatting is provided to make it easier to see the particular set
  of characters having certain values for enumerated properties, or to separate
  the statement of that property from other properties defined together
  in UnicodeData.txt. These files also include explicit
  listings of default values for the respective properties. These extracted, derived data files are further documented in
  the <a href="#Derived_Extracted">Derived Extracted Properties</a> section below.</p>
  
  <p>The UCD also contains a number of test data files, whose purpose is to provide
  standard test cases useful in verifying the implementation of complex Unicode
  algorithms. See the <a href="#Test_Files">Test Files</a> section below for more
  documentation.</p>

  <p>The remaining files in the Unicode Character Database do not directly specify Unicode 
  properties. The important ones and their functions are listed in <i>Table 5</i>.

<h3>4.4 <a name="Zipped_Files" href="#Zipped_Files">Zipped Files</a></h3>

  <p>Starting with Version 4.1.0, zipped versions of all of the UCD files,
  both data files and documentation files, are available under the <i>Public/zipped</i>
  directory on the Unicode website. Each collection of zipped files is located
  there in a numbered subdirectory corresponding to that version of the UCD.</p>
  
  <p>Two different zipped files are provided for each version:</p>

  <ul>  
  <li><b>Unihan.zip</b> is the zipped version of the very large Unihan data
  files</li>
  <li><b>UCD.zip</b> is the zipped
  version of all of the rest of the UCD data files, excluding 
  the Unihan data files.</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p>This bifurcation allows for better management of downloading version-specific
  information, because Unihan.zip contains all the pertinent CJK-related
  property information, while UCD.zip contains all of the rest of the UCD
  property information, for those who may not need the voluminous CJK data.</p>

  <p>Starting with Version 6.1.0 the main versioned directories for the UCD also contain a copy
  of UCD.zip, for convenience in access.</p>
  
  <p>In versions of the UCD prior to Version 4.1.0, zipped copies of the
  Unihan data files (which for those versions were released as a single large text file, Unihan.txt)
  are provided in the same directory as the UCD data files. These zipped files are only posted 
  for versions of the UCD in which Unihan.txt was updated.</p>

<h3>4.5 <a name="UCD_in_XML" href="#UCD_in_XML">UCD in XML</a></h3>

<p>Starting with Version 5.1.0, a set of XML data 
files are also released with each version of the UCD. Those 
data files make it possible to import and process the UCD property data using 
standard XML parsing tools, instead of the specialized parsing required for the 
various individual data files of the UCD.</p>

<h4>4.5.1 <a name="UAX42_doc" href="#UAX42_doc">UAX #42</a></h4>

<p>Unicode Standard Annex #42, "Unicode Character Database in XML" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX42">UAX42</a>] 
defines an XML schema 
which is used to incorporate all of the Unicode character property information 
into the XML version of the UCD. See that annex for details of the
schema and conventions regarding the grouping of property values for
more compact representations.</p>

<h4>4.5.2 <a name="XML_files" href="#XML_files">XML File List</a></h4>

  <p>The XML version of the UCD is contained in the <i>ucdxml</i> subdirectory
  of the UCD. The files are all zipped. The list of files is shown in
  <i>Table 6</i>.</p>

    <p>The "flat" file versions simply list all attributes with no
    particular compression. The "grouped" file versions apply the
    grouping mechanism described in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX42">UAX42</a>]
    to cut down on the size of the data files.</p>

<h2>5 <a name="Properties" href="#Properties">Properties</a></h2>

  <p>This section documents the Unicode character properties, relating them
  in detail to the particular UCD data files in which they are specified.
  For enumerated properties in particular, this section also documents the
  actual values which those properties can have.</p>
  
<h3>5.1 <a name="Property_Index" href="#Property_Index">Property Index</a></h3>

  <p><i>Table 7</i> provides a summary list of the Unicode character properties,
  excluding most of those specific to the Unihan
  data files [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unihan">Unihan</a>]. For a comparable
  index of CJK character properties, see Unicode Standard Annex #38, "Unicode Han Database (Unihan)" 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>].</p>
  
  <p>The properties are roughly organized into groups 
  based on their usage. This grouping is primarily for documentation convenience and 
  except for <a href="#Contributory_Properties">contributory properties</a>, has no 
  normative implications. Contributory properties are
  shown in this index with a <span class="lightgray">gray background</span>, to better distinguish them visually from
  ordinary (simple or derived) properties. 
  Deprecated properties and other properties 
    not recommended for support in public <a href="#Property_APIs">property APIs</a> are also shown 
    with a <span class="lightgray">gray background</span>.
    The link on each property leads to its 
  description in 
  <i>Table 9, <a href="#Property_List_Table">Property Table</a></i>.
  Any property marked as 
    <a href="#Deprecated_Properties">deprecated</a> in this index is
  also automatically considered <a href="#Obsolete_Properties">obsolete</a>.</p>

<h3>5.2 <a name="About_Property_Table" href="#About_Property_Table">About the Property Table</a></h3>

  <p><i>Table 9, <a href="#Property_List_Table">Property Table</a></i> 
  specifies the list of character properties
  defined in the UCD. 
  That table is divided into separate sections for each data
  file in the UCD. Data files which define a single property or a small number of properties are listed 
  first, followed by the data files which define a
  large number of properties: <a href="#DerivedCoreProperties.txt">DerivedCoreProperties.txt</a>,
  <a href="#DerivedNormalizationProps.txt">DerivedNormalizationProps.txt</a>,
  <a href="#PropList.txt">PropList.txt</a>, <a href="#UnicodeData.txt">UnicodeData.txt</a>, and <a href="#emoji-data.txt">emoji-data.txt</a>.
  In some instances for these files defining many properties, the
  entries in the property table are grouped by type, for clarity in presentation, rather than
  being listed alphabetically.</p>
    
  <p>In <i>Table 9,
  <a href="#Property_List_Table">Property Table</a></i> each property is described as follows:</p>
  
  <p><b>First Column.</b> This column contains the name of each of the character properties
  specified in the respective data file.
    Any special status for a property, such
    as whether it is <a href="#Obsolete_Properties">obsolete</a>, 
    <a href="#Deprecated_Properties">deprecated</a>, or 
    <a href="#Stabilized_Properties">stabilized</a>, is also indicated in
    the first column.</p>

  <p><b>Second Column.</b> This column 
  indicates the type of the property, according to the

  <ul>  
  <li><a name="Catalog"></a><b>Catalog</b> properties have enumerated values which are expected 
  to be regularly extended in successive versions of the Unicode Standard. This distinguishes them 
  from Enumeration properties.</li>
  <li><b>Enumeration</b> properties have enumerated values 
  which constitute a logical partition space; 
  new values will generally <i>not</i> be added to them in successive versions of the standard.</li>
  <li><b>Binary</b> properties are a special case of Enumeration properties, which
  have exactly two values: Yes and No (or True and False).</li>
  <li><b>String-valued</b> properties
  are typically mappings from a Unicode code point to another Unicode code point
  or sequence of Unicode code points; examples include case mappings and
  decomposition mappings.</li>
  <li>Properties of strings are properties defined for strings; in other
    words, their domain is a set of strings rather than a set of characters or code points. 
    Properties of strings are sometimes called "string properties" for short. For
    example, the file NamedSequences.txt defines names (which are themselves string
    values) for a certain set of specific character sequences. Properties of strings
    are not explicitly listed for the UCD in the <a href="#Property_List_Table">Property Table</a>, and hence are given no
    specific type symbol in the <a href="#Type_Key_Table">Property Type Key</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Numeric</b> properties specify the actual numeric values
  for digits and other characters associated with numbers in some way.</li>
  <li><b>Miscellaneous</b> properties are those properties that do not fit neatly into the other 
  property categories; they currently include character names, comments about characters,
  the <a href="#Script_Extensions">Script_Extensions</a> property,
  the <a href="#Equivalent_Unified_Ideograph">Equivalent_Unified_Ideograph</a> property, 
  and the <a href="#Unicode_Radical_Stroke">Unicode_Radical_Stroke</a> property 
  (a combination of numeric values)
  documented in Unicode Standard Annex #38, "Unicode Han Database (Unihan)" 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>].</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><b>Third Column.</b> This column indicates the 
  status of the property: <b>N</b>ormative or <b>I</b>nformative or <b>C</b>ontributory
  or <b>P</b>rovisional.</p>
  
  <p><b>Fourth Column.</b> This column provides a description of 
  the property or properties. This includes information on derivation for
  derived properties, as well as references to locations in the standard
  where the property is defined or discussed in detail.</p>
  
  <p>In the section of the table for <a href="#UnicodeData.txt">UnicodeData.txt</a>, 
  the data field numbers are also supplied in parentheses at the
  start of the description.</p>
  
  <p>For a few entries in the property table, values specified in the fields in a 
  data file only contribute to a full definition of a Unicode character property.
  For example, the values in field 1 (Name) in
  UnicodeData.txt do not provide all the values for the Name 
  property for all code points; <a href="#Jamo.txt">Jamo.txt</a> must also be used,
  and the Name property for CJK unified ideographs, Tangut ideographs, 
  Khitan Small Script ideographs,
  and Nushu ideographs is derived by rule.</p>
  
  <p>None of the Unicode character properties should be used simply on the
  basis of the descriptions in the property table without consulting the relevant 
  discussions in the Unicode Standard. Because of the enormous variety of
  characters in the repertoire of the Unicode Standard, character properties
  tend not to be self-evident in application, even when the names of the
  properties may seem familiar from their usage with much smaller legacy
  character encodings.</p>

<h3>5.3 <a name="Property_Definitions" href="#Property_Definitions">Property Definitions</a></h3>

  <p>This section contains the table which describes each character property and defines its status, organized by data file in the UCD.
  <i>Table 9</i> provides general descriptions of the Unicode character properties, their derivations,
  and/or their usage, as well as pointers to the respective parts of the standard where formal property definitions or additional
  information about the properties can be found. The property status column and any formal statement of the derivation
  of derived properties are definitive; however, <i>Table 9</i> does not provide formal definitions of the other properties
  and should not be interpreted as such. For details on the columns and overall organization of the table, see
  Section 5.2 <a href="#About_Property_Table">About the Property Table</a>.</p>

        For <i>nondefault</i> values of properties, if there is

  <p>For the extraction of Decomposition_Type, characters with canonical
  decomposition mappings in field 5 of UnicodeData.txt have no tag. For
  those characters, the extracted value is Decomposition_Type=Canonical. For characters
  with compatibility decomposition mappings, there are explicit tags
  in field 5, and the value of Decomposition_Type
  is equivalent to those tags. The value Decomposition_Type=Canonical is
  normative. Other values for Decomposition_Type are informative.</p>

  <p>The value of the Name property is extracted based on the actual string value
    of the data in field 1 of UnicodeData.txt, omitting any code points
    with the default null string value. Then for code points in the
    Hangul Syllables block, the Hangul
    Syllable Name Generation algorithm defined in <i>Section 3.12, Conjoining
    Jamo Behavior</i> of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] 
    is applied, to create the explicit formal
    names of all Hangul syllables. Characters whose names are algorithmically
    defined based on suffixing the code point to a specific identifying
    string prefix, such as CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E00, are listed with
    a compact range convention in DerivedName.txt, using an
    asterisk "*" character as the placeholder for the code point.
    See <i>Section 4.8, Name</i> of [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
    for more information about how the Name property is derived.</p>
  
  <p>Numeric_Value is extracted based on the actual numeric value of the
  data in field 8 of UnicodeData.txt or the values
  of the kPrimaryNumeric, kAccountingNumeric, or kOtherNumeric tags, for
  characters listed in the Unihan data files.</p>
  
  <p>Numeric_Type is extracted as follows. If fields 6, 7, and 8 in UnicodeData.txt
  are all non-empty, then Numeric_Type=Decimal. Otherwise, if fields 7 and 8 are both
  non-empty, then Numeric_Type=Digit. Otherwise, if field 8 is non-empty, then
  Numeric_Type=Numeric. 
  For characters listed in the Unihan data files,
  Numeric_Type=Numeric for characters that have kPrimaryNumeric, kAccountingNumeric,
  or kOtherNumeric tags. The default value is Numeric_Type=None.</p>
  
<h3>5.5 <a name="Contributory_Properties" href="#Contributory_Properties">Contributory Properties</a></h3>

  <p>Contributory properties contain sets of exceptions used in the generation of
  other properties derived from them. The contributory properties specifically concerned with
  identifiers and casing contribute to the maintenance of
  stability guarantees for properties and/or to invariance relationships
  between related properties. Other contributory properties are simply
  defined as a convenience for property derivation.</p>
  
  <p>Most contributory properties have names using
  the pattern "Other_XXX" and are used to derive the corresponding "XXX" property.
  For example, the Other_Alphabetic property is used in the derivation of the <a href="#Alphabetic">Alphabetic</a>
  property.</p>
  
  <p>Contributory properties are typically defined in 
  <a href="#PropList.txt">PropList.txt</a> and the corresponding derived property
  is then listed in
  <a href="#DerivedCoreProperties.txt">DerivedCoreProperties.txt</a>.</p>
  
  <p><a href="#Jamo_Short_Name">Jamo_Short_Name</a> is an unusual contributory
  property, both in terms of its name and how it is used. It is defined in
  its own property file, Jamo.txt, and is used to derive the Name
  property value for Hangul syllable characters, according to the rules
  spelled out in <i>Section 3.12, Conjoining Jamo Behavior</i> in
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
  
  <p><i>Contributory</i> is considered to be a distinct status for a Unicode
  character property. Contributory properties are neither <i>normative</i> nor
  <i>informative</i>. This distinct status is marked with
  the symbol "C" in the status column in the property table.

<h3>5.6 <a name="Casemapping" href="#Casemapping">Case and Case Mapping</a></h3>

  <p>Case for bicameral scripts and case mapping of characters are
  complicated topics in the Unicode Standard&#x2014;both because of
  their inherent algorithmic complexity and because of the number of characters
  and special edge cases involved.</p>
  
  <p>This section provides a brief roadmap to discussions about these
  topics, and specifications and definitions in the standard, as well
  as explaining which case-related properties are defined in the UCD.</p>
  
  <p><i>Section 3.13, Default Case Algorithms</i> in
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
  provides formal definitions for a number of case-related concepts (<i>cased</i>,
  <i>case-ignorable</i>,&nbsp;...), for
  case conversion (<i>toUppercase(X)</i>,&nbsp;...), and for case detection
  (<i>isUppercase(X)</i>,&nbsp;...). It also provides the formal definition
  of caseless matching for the standard, taking normalization
  into account.</p>
  
  <p><i>Section 4.2, Case</i> in
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
  introduces case and case mapping properties. <i>Table 4-3, Sources
  for Case Mapping Information</i> 
  in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] describes the kind of case-related
  information that is available in various data files of the UCD.
  <i>Table 11</i> lists those data files again, giving the
  explicit list of case-related properties defined in each. 
  The link on each property leads its description in 
  <i>Table 9, <a href="#Property_List_Table">Property Table</a></i>.</p>

  </div>
    
  <p>For compatibility with existing parsers, UnicodeData.txt only 
  contains case mappings for characters where they constitute one-to-one mappings; 
  it also omits 
  information about context-sensitive case mappings. Information about 
  these special cases can be found in the separate data file, 
  SpecialCasing.txt, expressed as separate properties.</p>

  <p><i>Section 5.18, Case Mappings</i>, in
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
  discusses various implementation issues for handling case,
  including language-specific case mapping, as for Greek and
  for Turkish. That section also describes case folding in particular detail.</p>
  
  <p>The special casing conditions associated with case mapping for Greek,
  Turkish, and Lithuanian are specified in an additional field in
  <a href="#SpecialCasing.txt">SpecialCasing.txt</a>. For example, the
  lowercase mapping for sigma in Greek varies according to its position
  in a word. The condition list does not constitute a formal character
  property in the UCD, because it is a statement about the context of occurrence
  of casing behavior for a character or characters, rather than a semantic
  attribute of those characters. Versions of the UCD from
  Version 3.2.0 to Version 5.0.0 <i>did</i> list property aliases
  for Special_Case_Condition (scc), but this was determined to be an error
  when the UCD was analyzed for representation in XML; consequently,
  the Special_Case_Condition property aliases were removed as of Version 5.1.0.</p>
  
  <p>Caseless matching is of particular concern for a number of text
  processing algorithms, so is also discussed at some length
  in Unicode Standard Annex #31, "Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax" 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX31">UAX31</a>] and
  in Unicode Technical Standard #10, "Unicode Collation Algorithm"
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UTS10">UTS10</a>].</p>
  
  <p>Further information about locale-specific casing conventions
  can be found in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#CLDR">CLDR</a>].</p>
  
  <h3>5.7 <a name="Property_Values" href="#Property_Values">Property Value Lists</a></h3>

  <p>The following subsections give summaries of property values for certain 
  Enumeration properties. Other property values 
  are documented in other, topically-specific annexes; for example, 
  the Line_Break property values are documented in
  Unicode Standard Annex #14, "Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm"
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX14">UAX14</a>] and the
  various segmentation-related property values are documented in
  Unicode Standard Annex #29, "Unicode Text Segmentation"
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX29">UAX29</a>].</p>
  
<h4>5.7.1 <a name="General_Category_Values" href="#General_Category_Values">General Category Values</a></h4>
  
  <p>The General_Category property of a code point provides for the 
  most general classification of that code point. It is usually 
  determined based on the primary characteristic of the assigned 
  character for that code point. For example, is the character a letter, 
  a mark, a number, punctuation, or a symbol, and if so, of what 
  type? Other General_Category values define the classification of
  code points which are not assigned to regular graphic characters,
  including such statuses as private-use, control, surrogate code 
  point, and reserved unassigned.</p>
  
  <p>Many characters have multiple uses, and not all such cases 
  can be captured entirely by the General_Category value. For example,
  the General_Category value of Latin, Greek, or Hebrew letters does not
  attempt to cover (or preclude) the numerical use of such letters
  as Roman numerals or in other numerary systems. Conversely, the
  General_Category of ASCII digits 0..9 as Nd (decimal digit)
  neither attempts to cover (or preclude) the occasional use of
  these digits as letters in various orthographies. The General_Category
  is simply the first-order, most usual categorization of a
  character.</p>
  
  <p>For more information about the General_Category
  property, see <i>Chapter 4, Character Properties</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>

  <p>The values in the General_Category field in UnicodeData.txt
  make use of the short, abbreviated property value aliases
  for General_Category. For convenience in reference, <i>Table 12</i>
  lists all the abbreviated and long value aliases for General_Category values, reproduced from
  <a href="#PropertyValueAliases.txt">PropertyValueAliases.txt</a>, 
  along with a brief description of each category.</p>

  </div>
  
  <p>Note that the value gc=Cn does not actually
  occur in UnicodeData.txt, because that data file does not list
  unassigned code points.</p>
  
  <p>The distinctions between some General_Category values
  are somewhat arbitrary for edge cases, particularly those involving
  symbols and punctuation. For example, a number of multiple-function
  ASCII characters, including "@", "#", "%", and "&amp;", have long
  been classified as Other_Punctuation (gc=Po), although they
  are not among the characters used as punctuation marks in traditional
  Western typography. Other characters may also be ambiguous between
  functioning to organize and delimit textual units (punctuation-like)
  or to represent concepts (symbol-like). Likewise, it may not always
  be clear whether some symbols are primarily used for mathematics
  or whether they are general symbols with occasional or even common use in mathematics.
  For example, many arrow symbols are classed as Other_Symbol,
  although they are widely used in mathematics. The
  General_Category values constitute a rough partitioning of characters
  to make distinctions for algorithmic processing, but do not
  provide a definitive classification for such overlapping
  or ambiguous usage of characters.</p>
  
  <p>Characters with the quotation-related General_Category values
  Pi or Pf may behave like opening punctuation (gc=Ps) or closing
  punctuation (gc=Pe), depending on usage and quotation conventions.</p>
  
  <p>General_Category values in the table highlighted
  in light blue (LC, L, M, N, P, S, Z, C) stand for groupings of related
  General_Category values. The classes they represent can be derived by
  unions of the relevant simple values, as shown in the table. The abbreviated
  and long value aliases for these classes are provided as a convenience
  for implementations, such as regex, which may wish to match more generic
  categories, such as "letter" or "number", rather than the detailed
  subtypes for General_Category. These aliases for groupings
  of General_Category values do not occur in UnicodeData.txt, which instead
  always specifies the enumerated subtype for the General_Category of a character.</p>
  
    <p>The symbol &quot;L&amp;&quot; is a label used to stand for any
    combination of uppercase, lowercase or titlecase letters 
    (Lu, Ll, or Lt), in the first part of comments in the data files of the UCD.
    It is equivalent to gc=LC, but is only a label in comments, and is
    not expected to be used as an identifier for regular expression matching.</p>
  
    <p>The Unicode Standard does not assign nondefault property
    values to control characters (gc=Cc), except 
    for certain well-defined exceptions involving the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm,
    the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm, and Unicode Text Segmentation. 
    Also, implementations will usually assign 
    behavior to certain line breaking control 
    characters&#x2014;most notably U+000D and U+000A (CR and LF)&#x2014;according to platform conventions.

  <p>Please refer to Unicode Standard Annex #9, "Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm"
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX9">UAX9</a>] for 
  an an explanation of the significance 
  of these values when formatting bidirectional text.</p>
  
  <p>The four enumerated values for the isolate controls were added
  in Unicode 6.3. That means there is a discontinuity in the enumeration for Bidi_Class
  between Unicode 6.2 and Unicode 6.3 (and later versions) which parsers of
  UnicodeData.txt and DerivedBidiClass.txt must take into account.</p>
  
<h4>5.7.3 <a name="Character_Decomposition_Mappings" href="#Character_Decomposition_Mappings">Character Decomposition Mapping</a></h4>

  <p>The value of the Decomposition_Mapping property for a character is provided
  in field 5 of UnicodeData.txt. This is a string-valued property, consisting of a sequence
  of one or more Unicode code points. The default value of the Decomposition_Mapping
  property is the code point of the character itself. The use of the default value
  for a character is indicated by leaving field 5 empty in UnicodeData.txt.
  Informally, the value of the Decomposition_Mapping property for a character
  is known simply as its <i>decomposition mapping</i>. When a character's decomposition
  mapping is other than the default value, the decomposition mapping is printed out
  explicitly in the names list for the Unicode code charts.</p>
  
  <p>The prefixed tags supplied with a subset of the decomposition mappings generally indicate formatting 
  information. Where no such tag is given, the mapping is canonical. Conversely, the presence of a 
  formatting tag also indicates that the mapping is a compatibility mapping and not a canonical 
  mapping. In the absence of other formatting information in a compatibility mapping, the tag is 
  used to distinguish it from canonical mappings.</p>
  
  <p>In some instances a canonical mapping or a compatibility mapping may consist of a single 
  character. For a canonical mapping, this indicates that the character is a canonical equivalent of 
  another single character. For a compatibility mapping, this indicates that the character is a 
  compatibility equivalent of another single character.</p>
  
  <p>A canonical mapping may also consist of a pair of characters, but is never
  longer than two characters. When a canonical mapping consists of a pair of characters,
  the first character may itself be a character with a decomposition mapping, but the
  second character never has a decomposition mapping.</p>
  
  <p>Compatibility mappings can be much longer than canonical mappings. For historical reasons, the
  longest compatibility mapping is 18 characters long. Compatibility mappings are guaranteed
  to be no longer than 18 characters, although most consist of just a few characters.</p>
  
  <p>The compatibility formatting 
  tags used in the UCD are listed in <i>Table 14</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Note: </b>There is a difference between decomposition and the 
  Decomposition_Mapping property. The 
  Decomposition_Mapping property is a string-valued property whose
  values (mappings) are defined in UnicodeData.txt, while the decomposition (also termed &quot;full 
  decomposition&quot;) is defined in <i>Section 3.7, Decomposition</i> in
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>] to use those mappings <i>recursively.</i></p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>The canonical decomposition is formed by recursively applying the canonical mappings, then 
    applying the Canonical Ordering Algorithm.</li>
    <li>The compatibility decomposition is formed by recursively applying the canonical <b>and</b> 
    compatibility mappings, then applying the Canonical Ordering Algorithm.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Starting from Unicode 2.1.9, the decomposition mappings in
  <a href="#UnicodeData.txt">UnicodeData.txt</a> can be used to derive the 
  full decomposition of any single character in canonical order, without 
  the need to separately apply the Canonical Ordering Algorithm. 
  However, canonical ordering of combining character sequences <b><i>must</i></b> still be applied 
  in decomposition when normalizing source text which contains any combining marks.</p>
  
  <p>The normalization of Hangul conjoining jamos and of Hangul syllables depends on algorithmic
  mapping, as specified in <i>Section 3.12, Conjoining Jamo Behavior</i> in 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].
  That algorithm specifies the full decomposition of all precomposed Hangul syllables, but
  effectively it is equivalent to the recursive application of pairwise decomposition
  mappings, as for all other Unicode characters. Formally, the Decomposition_Mapping
  property value for a Hangul syllable is the pairwise decomposition and not the full 
  decomposition.</p>
  
	<p>Each character with the <a href="#Hangul_Syllable_Type">Hangul_Syllable_Type</a> 
	value LVT will have a Decomposition_Mapping consisting of a character with an LV value and a 
	character with a T value. Thus for U+CE31 the Decomposition_Mapping is &lt;U+CE20, U+11B8&gt;, 
	rather than &lt;U+110E, U+1173, U+11B8&gt;.</p>
        
  <p>The Unihan property kCompatibilityVariant consists of a listing of the
  canonical Decomposition_Mapping property values just for CJK compatibility ideographs. Because its values are
  derived from UnicodeData.txt, it is formally considered to be a derived property. The exact statement
  of the derivation for kCompatibilityVariant is listed in Unicode Standard Annex #38, "Unicode Han Database (Unihan)" 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX38">UAX38</a>].</p>
	
<h4>5.7.4 <a name="Canonical_Combining_Class_Values" href="#Canonical_Combining_Class_Values">Canonical Combining Class Values</a></h4>

  those numerical values also have explicit symbolic labels as property

      <p>Some of the Canonical_Combining_Class values in the table are not currently used 
    for any characters but are specified here for completeness. Some
    values do not have long symbolic aliases and are not listed in PropertyValueAliases.txt.
    Do not assume that absence of a long symbolic alias implies
    non-use of a particular Canonical_Combining_Class. See
    <a href="#DerivedCombiningClass.txt">DerivedCombiningClass.txt</a> for
    a complete listing of the use of Canonical_Combining_Class values for
    any particular version of the UCD.</p>
    
    <p>For use in regular expression matching, fixed position classes (ccc=10 through
    ccc=199) which actually occur in the Unicode Character Database for any version are
    given predictable aliases of the form "Ccc10", "Ccc11", and so forth. The complete list of such aliases which
    are actually defined can be found in PropertyValueAliases.txt.</p> 
    
    <p>The character property invariants regarding Canonical_Combining_Class
      guarantee that values, once assigned, will never change, and
      that all values used will be in the range 0..254. See 
      <a href="#Invariants_in_Implementations">Invariants in Implementations</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Combining marks with ccc=224 (Left) follow their base character in storage,
    as for all combining marks, but are rendered visually on the left
    side of them. For all past versions of the UCD and
    continuing with this version of the UCD, only two
    tone marks used in certain notations for Hangul syllables have ccc=224.
    Those marks are actually rendered visually on the left side of
    the preceding <i>grapheme cluster</i>, in the case of Hangul syllables
    resulting from sequences of conjoining jamos.</p>
    
    <p>Those few instances of combining marks with ccc=Left should be
    distinguished from the far more numerous examples of left-side vowel
    signs and vowel letters in Brahmi-derived scripts. 
    The Canonical_Combining_Class value is zero (Not_Reordered) for both
    ordinary, left-side (reordrant) vowel signs such as
    U+093F DEVANAGARI VOWEL SIGN I and for Thai-style left-side
    (Logical_Order_Exception=Yes) vowel letters such as U+0E40
    THAI CHARACTER SARA E. The "Not_Reordered" of ccc=Not_Reordered
    refers to the behavior of the character in terms of the Canonical
    Ordering Algorithm as part of the definition of Unicode Normalization;
    it does <i>not</i> refer to any issues of visual reordering of glyphs
    involved in display and rendering. See "Canonical Ordering
    Algorithm" in <i>Section 3.11,

  <p>A number of derived properties related to Unicode normalization are called
  the "Quick_Check" properties. These are defined to enable various optimizations

<p>The Quick_Check property values are recommended for exposure in a public library API
which supports Unicode character properties, because they can be used to optimize
code that needs to normalize Unicode strings. They enable fast checking of whether
some input strings are already in the desired normalization form. This may make
it possible to bypass
the more time-consuming call to run the complete Unicode Normalization Algorithm
on the input string.</p>

<p>In contrast, some normalization-related Unicode character properties
are <i>not</i> recommended for exposure in a public library API. Notably, these include
<a href="#Decomposition_Mapping">Decomposition_Mapping</a>, 
<a href="#Composition_Exclusion">Composition_Exclusion</a>, 
and the derived <a href="#Full_Composition_Exclusion">Full_Composition_Exclusion</a>.
These properties are only used internally in a conformant implementation of
the Unicode Normalization Algorithm. Exposing them in a public API can lead
to confusion by users of the API. In particular, Decomposition_Mapping is very
easy to misinterpret as designating the <i>decomposition</i> of a character, 
also known as the character's <i>full decomposition</i>. See Definitions D62 and D64
in <i>Section 3.7, Decomposition</i> in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
    
<h4>5.7.6 <a name="Property_Values_As_Sets" href="#Property_Values_As_Sets">Properties Whose Values Are Sets of Values</a></h4>
  
<p>Most properties have a single value associated with each code point.
However, some properties may instead associate a set of multiple
different values with each code point. For example, the provisional
kCantonese property, which lists Cantonese pronunciations
for unified CJK ideographs, has values which consist of a set of
zero or more romanized pronunciation strings. Thus, the Unihan
Database contains an entry:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
U+342B	kCantonese	gun3 hung1 zung1
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This line is to be interpreted as associating a set of three string values,
{"gun3", "hung1", "zung1"} with the kCantonese property for U+342B.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Script_Extensions property has values which
consist of a set of one or more Script property values. Thus the
property file ScriptExtensions.txt in the UCD contains an entry:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
0640          ; Adlm Arab Mand Mani Phlp Rohg Sogd Syrc # Lm       ARABIC TATWEEL
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This line is to be interpreted as associating a set of 
eight enumerated
Script property values, {Adlm, Arab, Mand, Mani, Phlp, Rohg, Sogd, Syrc},  with the Script_Extensions
property for U+0640.</p>

<p>In the case of Script_Extensions, in particular, the set of sets which
constitute meaningful values of the property is relatively small, and could be explicitly
evaluated for any particular Unicode version. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
{{Adlm, Arab, Mand, Mani, Phlp, Rohg, Sogd, Syrc}, {Arab, Copt}, {Arab, Rohg}, {Arab, Syrc}, {Arab, Thaa}, {Arab, Syrc, Thaa}, {Armn, Geor}, ...}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>However, an enumeration of this set of set values is unlikely to be
of much implementation value, and would be likely to change significantly between
versions of the standard. In other cases, such as for properties definining pronunciation
readings for unified CJK ideographs, these sets of sets are completely open-ended, and there
is no point to attempting to provide explicit enumerations of such sets in the UCD.</p>

<p>The order of the element values in such sets may or may not be significant.
For example, the order among the element values for kCantonese and for
Script_Extensions is not significant. By way of contrast, when the kMandarin
property shows two values for a code point, the first value is used to
indicate a preferred pronunciation for zh-Hans (CN) and the second a
preferred pronunciation for zh-Hant (TW).</p>

<p>For data file format considerations regarding properties which take
sets of values, see Section 4.2.8 <a href="#Multiple_Values">Multiple Values for Properties</a>. 
For considerations regarding validation of such
properties, see Section 5.11.5 <a href="#Validation_of_Multivalued">Validation of Multivalued Properties</a>.
See also Unicode Technical Standard #18, "Unicode Regular Expressions"

<h3>5.8 <a name="Property_And_Value_Aliases" href="#Property_And_Value_Aliases">Property and Property Value Aliases</a></h3>

  <p>Both Unicode character properties themselves and their values are

  The aliases for properties are defined in
  PropertyAliases.txt. The aliases for property values are defined in
  PropertyValueAliases.txt.</p>

  <p>Aliases are defined as ASCII-compatible identifiers, using only uppercase or
  lowercase A-Z, digits, and underscore "_". Case is not significant
  when comparing aliases, but the preferred form used in the data files
  for longer aliases is to titlecase them.</p>
  
  <p>Aliases may be translated in appropriate environments, and additional
  aliases may be useful in certain contexts. There is no requirement that
  only the aliases defined in the alias files of the UCD be used when
  referring to Unicode character properties or their values; however, their
  use is recommended for interoperability in data formats or in
  programmatic contexts.</p>
  
  <p>Aliases may be provided 
  for provisional properties. There are stability guarantees for property aliases and property
  value aliases, but no stability guarantees for provisional properties or other
  provisional data files; consequently, there can also be
  no stability guarantee for property aliases or property value aliases associated with provisional
  properties.</p>
  
  <h4>5.8.1 <a name="Property_Aliases" href="#Property_Aliases">Property Aliases</a></h4>
  
  <p>In PropertyAliases.txt, the first field typically specifies an abbreviated
  symbolic name for the property, and the second field specifies the
  long symbolic name for the property. These are the preferred aliases.
  Additional aliases for a few properties are specified in the third
  or subsequent fields.</p>
  
  <p>Aliases for normative and informative
  properties defined in the Unihan data files are included in PropertyAliases.txt,
  beginning with Version 5.2.</p>
  
  <p>The long symbolic name alias is self-descriptive, and is 
  treated as the official name of
  a Unicode character property. For clarity it is used whenever possible 
  when referring to that
  property in this annex and elsewhere in the Unicode Standard.
  For example: "The Line_Break property is discussed in Unicode Standard Annex #14, "Unicode Line 
  Breaking Algorithm" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX14">UAX14</a>]."</p>
  
  <p>The abbreviated symbolic name alias is usually short and less mnemonic,
  but is useful for expressions such as "lb=BA" in data or in other 
  contexts where the meaning is clear. Note that although
  the UCD documentation refers to this first symbolic name alias as "abbreviated", there
  is no requirement that the first field be an actual abbreviation or even that
  it be shorter than the "long" symbolic name alias. If the long symbolic name alias is
  already a short identifier, in many cases the "abbreviated" symbolic name alias is 
  identical to the value in the second field. There is also one principled class where the
  "abbreviated" field is actually longer than the "long" field&#x2014;the property aliases
  for the Unihan tags. In that case, the second field deliberately matches the Unihan
  tags exactly, so that it can serve its function as being the official property value
  identifier. Then, because there was no systematic way to abbreviate Unihan tags, while
  still retaining any reasonable comprehensibility for them, the first field in
  PropertyAliases.txt was created by systematically prefixing "cj" to each Unihan tag, resulting
  in labels with the mnemonic "cjk" prefix. Thus it is not a mistake that in such
  cases the first field contains a longer string than the second field. Implementations
  should not build in assumptions about the relative length of these symbolic name aliases.</p>
  
  <p>The property aliases specified in PropertyAliases.txt constitute
  a unique namespace. When using these symbolic values, no
  alias for one property will match an alias for another property.</p>
  
  <h4>5.8.2 <a name="Property_Value_Aliases" href="#Property_Value_Aliases">Property Value Aliases</a></h4>
  
  <p>In PropertyValueAliases.txt, the first field contains the
  abbreviated alias for a Unicode property, the second field specifies 
  an abbreviated symbolic name for a value of that property, and 
  the third field specifies the
  long symbolic name for that value of that property. These are the 
  preferred aliases.
  Additional aliases for some property values may be specified in the fourth
  or subsequent fields. For example, for binary properties, the
  abbreviated alias for the True value is "Y", and the long alias
  is "Yes", but each entry also specifies "T" and "True" as
  additional aliases for that value, as shown in <i>Table 18</i>.</p>
  
  <p class="caption">Table 18. <a name="Binary_Values_Table" href="#Binary_Values_Table">Binary Property Value Aliases</a></p>

   </div>

  <p>Not every property value has an associated alias. Property value
  aliases are typically supplied for catalog and enumeration
  properties, which have well-defined, enumerated values. It does not
  make sense to specify property value aliases, for example, for
  the Numeric_Value property, whose value could be any number, or
  for a string-valued property such as Simple_Lowercase_Mapping, whose values
  are mappings from one code point to another.</p>
  
  <p>The Canonical_Combining_Class property requires special handling
  in PropertyValueAliases.txt. The values of this property are numeric,
  but they comprise a closed, enumerated set of values. The more
  important of those values are given symbolic name aliases.
  In PropertyValueAliases.txt, the second field provides the numeric
  value, while the third field contains the abbreviated symbolic
  name alias and the fourth field contains the long symbolic
  name alias for that numeric value. For example:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  <pre>
ccc; 230; A    ; Above
ccc; 232; AR   ; Above_Right
  </pre>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Taken by themselves, property value aliases do not constitute
  a unique namespace. The abbreviated aliases, in particular,
  are often re-used as aliases for values for different properties.
  All of the binary property value aliases, for example, make
  use of the same "Y", "Yes", "T", "True" symbols. Property value
  aliases may also overlap the symbols used for property aliases.
  For example, "Sc" is the abbreviated alias for the
  "Currency_Symbol" value of the General_Category property, but
  it is also the abbreviated alias for the Script property.
  However, the aliases for values for any single property are
  always unique within the context of that property. That
  means that expressions that combine a property alias and
  a property value alias, such as "lb=BA" or "gc=Sc" <i>always</i>
  refer unambiguously just to one value of one given property,
  and will not match any other value of any other property.</p>
  
  <p>Prior to Version 6.1.0, the property value alias entries for three properties,
  Age, Block, and Joining_Group, made use of a special metavalue
  "n/a" in the field for the abbreviated alias. This should
  be understood as meaning that no abbreviated alias was
  defined for that value for that property, rather than as
  an alias per se. Starting with Version 6.1.0, all property values for those
  three properties have abbreviated aliases, so there is no current use of the "n/a" metavalue.</p>
  
  <p>In a few cases, because of longstanding legacy practice
  in referring to values of a property by short identifiers,
  the abbreviated alias and the long alias are the same. This
  can be seen, for example, in some property value aliases
  for the Line_Break property and the Grapheme_Cluster_Break
  property.</p>
  
  <p>The property <a href="#Script_Extensions">Script_Extensions</a>
  consists of enumerated sets of Script property values. The set of those sets is potentially
  open-ended, and no property value aliases are defined for them.</p>
    
<h3>5.9 <a name="Matching_Rules" href="#Matching_Rules">Matching Rules</a></h3>

  <p>When matching Unicode character property names 
  and values, it is strongly recommended that all 
  <a href="#Property_Aliases">Property and Property Value Aliases</a>
  be recognized. For best results in matching, rather than using
  exact binary comparisons, the following loose matching rules
  should be observed.</p> 

  <h4>5.9.1 <a name="Matching_Numeric" href="#Matching_Numeric">Matching Numeric Property Values</a></h4>
  <p>For all numeric properties, and for properties such as Unicode_Radical_Stroke 
  which are constructed from combinations 
  of numeric values, use loose matching rule UAX44-LM1 when comparing property values.</p>
  
  <p><i><b><a name="UAX44-LM1" href="#UAX44-LM1">UAX44-LM1</a>.</b></i> Apply numeric equivalences.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;01.00&quot; is equivalent to &quot;1&quot;.</li>
    <li>&quot;1.666667&quot; in the UCD is a repeating fraction, and 
    equivalent to "10/6" or "5/3".</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>5.9.2 <a name="Matching_Names" href="#Matching_Names">Matching Character Names</a></h4>
  <p>Unicode character names constitute a special case. Formally, they are values
  of the Name property. While each Unicode character name for an assigned character
  is guaranteed to be unique, names are assigned in such a way that
  the presence or absence of spaces cannot be used to distinguish them. 
  Furthermore, implementations sometimes create identifiers from Unicode
  character names by inserting underscores for spaces. For best results
  in comparing Unicode character names, use loose matching rule UAX44-LM2.</p>
  
  <p><i><b><a name="UAX44-LM2" href="#UAX44-LM2">UAX44-LM2</a>.</b></i> Ignore case, whitespace, underscore (&#39;_&#39;), and all medial hyphens except the hyphen in 
  U+1180 HANGUL JUNGSEONG O-E.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;zero-width space&quot; is equivalent to &quot;ZERO WIDTH SPACE&quot; or &quot;zerowidthspace&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;character -a&quot; is <i>not</i> equivalent to &quot;character a&quot;</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In this rule "medial hyphen" is to be construed as a hyphen
  occurring immediately between two letters in the normative Unicode character
  name, as published in the Unicode names list, and not to any hyphen that may
  transiently occur medially as a result of removing whitespace before removing hyphens in
  a particular implementation of matching. Thus the hyphen in the name
  U+10089 LINEAR B IDEOGRAM B107M HE-GOAT is medial, and should be ignored
  in loose matching, but the hyphen in the name U+0F39 TIBETAN MARK TSA -PHRU is
  <i>not</i> medial, and should not be ignored in loose matching.</p>
  
  <p>An implementation of this loose matching rule can obtain
  the correct results when comparing two strings by doing the following three
  operations, in order:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>remove all medial hyphens (except the medial hyphen in the name for U+1180)</li>
    <li>remove all whitespace and underscore characters</li>
    <li>apply toLowercase() to both strings</li> 
  </ol>
  
  <p>After applying these three operations, if the two strings
  compare binary equal, then they are considered to match.</p>
  
  <p>This is a logical statement of how the rule works. If programmed
  carefully, an implementation of the matching rule can transform the strings in
  a single pass. It is also possible to compare two name strings for loose matching
  while transforming each string incrementally.</p>
  
  <p>Loose matching rule UAX44-LM2 is also appropriate for matching
  character name aliases, the names of named character sequences, and code point labels, which all share the
  unique namespace (and matching behavior) of Unicode character names. See <i>Section 4.8, Name</i> in 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Unicode">Unicode</a>]</p>
  
  <p>Implementations of name matching should use extreme care when matching
  non-standard, alternative names for particular characters. The Name Uniqueness Policy
  in the Unicode Consortium Stability
  Policies [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Stability">Stability</a>] guarantees that
  the Unicode Standard will never add a character whose name would match an existing
  encoded character, according to matching rule UAX44-LM2. However, any <i>other</i>
  name for a character might be used in the future.</p>
  
  <p>The following is a concrete example of the kind of trouble that can occur.
  Prior to Unicode 6.0 some implementations of regex allowed matching of the name "BELL" for
  the control code U+0007. When Unicode 6.0 added a <i>different</i> encoded character,
  U+1F514 BELL for emoji symbols, those regex implementations broke.</p>
  
  <p>As of Version 6.1 of the Unicode Standard, the most commonly occurring
  alternative names for control codes, as well as many commonly used abbreviations for
  Unicode format characters, have been added as character name aliases. This automatically
  excludes all such alternative names and abbreviations from the potential pool for
  future Unicode character names, because name uniqueness is defined over the namespace
  which includes both character names and character name aliases. That exclusion should
  reduce the potential for surprises similar to the "BELL" case, where implementers
  assume that a name for a control code is already well-defined.</p>
  
  <h4>5.9.3 <a name="Matching_Symbolic" href="#Matching_Symbolic">Matching Symbolic Values</a></h4>
  <p>Property aliases and property value aliases are symbolic values. When
  comparing them, use loose matching rule UAX44-LM3.</p>
  
  <p><i><b><a name="UAX44-LM3" href="#UAX44-LM3">UAX44-LM3</a>.</b></i> Ignore case, whitespace, underscore (&#39;_&#39;), 
  hyphens, and any initial prefix string "is".</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;linebreak&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Line_Break&quot; or &quot;Line-break&quot;</li>
    <li>"lb=BA" is equivalent to "lb=ba" or "LB=BA"</li>
    <li>"Script=Greek" is equivalent to "Script=isGreek" or "Script=Is_Greek"</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Loose matching is generally appropriate for the property values of
  Catalog, Enumeration, and Binary properties, which have symbolic aliases
  defined for their values.  
  Loose matching should not be done for the property values of String-valued properties, 
  which do not have symbolic aliases defined for their values; exact
  matching for String-valued property values is important, as 
  case distinctions or other distinctions in those values may be significant.</p>
  
  <p>For loose matching of symbolic values, an initial prefix string "is" is
  ignored. The reason for this is that APIs returning property values are often
  named using the convention of prefixing "is" (or "Is" or "Is_", and so forth) to
  a property value. Ignoring any initial "is" on a symbolic value during loose
  matching is likely to produce the best results in application areas such as
  regex. Removal of an initial "is" string for a loose matching comparison only
  needs to be done once for a symbolic value, and need not be tested recursively.
  There are no property aliases or property value aliases of the form
  "isisisisistooconvoluted" defined just to test implementation edge cases.</p>
  
  <p>Existing and future property aliases and property value
  aliases are guaranteed to be unique within their relevant namespaces, even
  if an initial prefix string "is" is ignored. The existing cases of note
  for aliases that do start with "is" are: dt=Iso (Decomposition_Type=Isolated)
  and lb=IS. The Decomposition_Type value alias does not cause any problem,
  because there is no contrasting value alias dt=o (Decomposition_Type=olated).
  For lb=IS, note that the "IS" is the <i>entire</i> property value alias, and
  is not a prefix. There is no null value for the Line_Break property for it
  to contrast with, but implementations of loose matching should be careful
  of this edge case, so that "lb=IS" is not misinterpreted as matching a null
  value.</p>
  
  <p>Implementations sometimes use other syntactic constructs
  that interact with loose matching. For example, the property matching
  expression \p{L} may be defaulted to refer to the Unicode General_Category
  property: \p{General_Category=L}. For more information about
  the use of property values in regular expressions and other environments,
  see <i>Section 1.2, Properties</i>, in Unicode Technical Standard #18,
  "Unicode Regular Expressions" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>].</p>

<h3>5.10 <a name="Invariants" href="#Invariants">Invariants</a></h3>

  <p>Property values in the UCD may be subject to correction
  in subsequent versions of the standard, as errors are found. Furthermore, any
  new version of the Unicode Standard may introduce new property values for
  a given property, except where the set of allowable values is fixed
  by the property type (such as for binary properties), or where the
  set of allowable values is subject to a provision of the Unicode
  Character Encoding Stability Policy [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Stability">Stability</a>]. 
  Finally, a new version may also
  introduce new properties or new data files in the UCD.</p>
   
  <p>Implementers of the UCD need to be aware of
  such changes when updating to new versions. However, some property values
  and some aspects of the file formats are considered
  invariant. This section documents such invariants.</p>
  
  <h4>5.10.1 <a name="Property_Invariants" href="#Property_Invariants">Character Property Invariants</a></h4>
  
  <p>All formally guaranteed invariants for properties or property values 
  are described in
  the Unicode Character Encoding Stability Policy 
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Stability">Stability</a>].
  That policy and the list of invariants it enumerates are
  maintained outside the context of the Unicode Standard per se.
  They are not part of the standard, but rather are constraints
  on what can and cannot change in the standard between versions,
  and on what decisions the Unicode Technical Committee can and
  cannot take regarding the standard.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to the formally guaranteed invariants described
  in the Unicode Character Encoding Stability Policy, this section
  notes a few additional points regarding character property
  invariants in the UCD.</p>
  
  <p>Some character properties are simply considered <i>immutable</i>: once
  assigned, they are never changed. For example, a character's name
  is immutable, because of its importance in exact identification
  of the character. The Canonical_Combining_Class and
  Decomposition_Mapping of a character are immutable, because of their
  importance to the stability of the Unicode Normalization Algorithm
  [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX15">UAX15</a>].</p>
  
  <p>The list of immutable character properties is shown in
  <i>Table 19</i>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>If a property has "Yes" in the "Assignable to New?" column
    in <i>Table 19</i>, that means that the property value is immutable once
    it is initially assigned to a newly encoded character. The value for a
    reserved code point takes the default value, as shown
    in the third column of the table, but <i>may change</i> from the default value
    once the character is encoded. On the other hand, if a property has "No"
    in the "Assignable to New?" column, that means that it is <i>absolutely</i>
    immutable: all code points, including reserved code points, have a specific
    property value assigned, and that value does not change if a new character
    is encoded at a particular reserved code point in a future version of the
    standard.</p>

  <p>The Name_Alias property is unusual, in that there can be more
    than one formal name alias assigned to a given encoded character. The default
    value for Name_Alias is the null string, but once any Name_Alias is assigned
    to an encoded character, that value is immutable. If more than one formal
    name alias is assigned to the same encoded character, each of those values is
    immutable.</p>

  <p>A set of binary character properties associated with identifiers have
    a different kind of immutability, which can be described as <i>locked to Yes</i>.
    This results from the way these properties are used in the specification of identifiers.
    Unicode identifiers have the characteristic of stability between versions, so that
    once a string is specified as belonging to a particular class of identifier, it must <i>stay</i>
    in that class for future versions of the standard. Because of that requirement
    for identifier stability, there are associated constraints on
    how the related character properties can change. In particular, the identifier-related properties
    listed in <i>Table 19a</i> may have their values for any particular assigned character
    change from No to Yes between versions of the standard, but once a character has the
    value Yes, that value is locked in, and cannot ever be changed back to No.</p>

   <p>In some cases, a property is not immutable, but the list
  of possible values that it can have is considered
  invariant. For example, while at least some General_Category
  values are subject to change and correction, the enumerated set
  of possible values that the General_Category property can have
  is fixed and cannot be added to in the future. However, not all Enumeration
  properties used by Unicode algorithms have immutable lists of
  property values. For example, the enumerated lists of values
  associated with the Line_Break and the Word_Break properties have
  changed in the past, and may be changed again in future versions
  of the standard.</p>

    <p>All characters other than 
    those of General_Category Mn or Mc are guaranteed to have Canonical_Combining_Class=0.
    </p>

    <p>In Unicode 4.0 and thereafter, the General_Category value 
    <i>Decimal_Number</i> (Nd), and 
    the Numeric_Type value <i>Decimal</i> (de) are defined to be co-extensive; 
    that is, the set of 
    characters having General_Category=Nd will always be the same as the 
    set of characters having NumericType=de.</p>

  <h4>5.10.2 <a name="File_Invariants" href="#File_Invariants">UCD File Format Invariants</a></h4>
  
  <p>There are also some constraints on allowable change in the
  file formats for UCD files. In general, the 
  <a href="#Format_Conventions">file format conventions</a> are
  changed as little as possible, to minimize the impact on
  implementations which parse the machine-readable data files.
  However, some of the constraints on allowable file format
  change go beyond conservatism in format and instead have
  the status of invariants. These guarantees apply in particular
  to UnicodeData.txt, the very first data file associated with
  the UCD.</p>
  
  <p>The number and order of the fields in UnicodeData.txt is fixed.
     Any additional information about character properties to be added
     to the UCD in the future will 
     appear in separate data files, rather than being added as an 
     additional field to UnicodeData.txt or by reinterpretation
     of any of the existing fields.</p>
       
  <h4>5.10.3 <a name="Invariants_in_Implementations" href="#Invariants_in_Implementations">Invariants in Implementations</a></h4>
  
  <p>Applications may wish to take the various character property
  and file format 
  invariants into account when choosing how to implement character properties.</p>
   
      <p>The Canonical_Combining_Class offers a good example. The
      character property invariants regarding Canonical_Combining_Class
      guarantee that values, once assigned, will never change, and
      that all values used will be in the range 0..254. This means
      that the Canonical_Combining_Class can be safely implemented
      in an unsigned byte and that any value stored in a table for
      an existing character will not need to be updated dynamically
      for a later version.</p>
      
      <p>In practice, for Canonical_Combining_Class far fewer 
      than 256 values are used. Unicode 3.0 used 53 values;
      Unicode 3.1 through Unicode 4.1 used 54 values; and Unicode 5.0
      through Unicode 9.0 used 55 values. New, non-zero
      Canonical_Combining_Class values are seldom added to the standard.
      (For details about this history, see 
      <a href="#DerivedCombiningClass.txt">DerivedCombiningClass.txt</a>.) 
      Implementations may take advantage of this fact for compression,
      because only the ordering of 
      the non-zero values, and not their absolute values, matters for 
      the Canonical Ordering Algorithm. In principle, it would be 
      possible for up to 255 values to be used in the future, but
      the chances of the actual number of values exceeding 128
      are remote at this point. There are implementation advantages 
      in restricting the number of internal class values to 
      128&#x2014;for example, the ability to use signed bytes without 
      implicit widening to ints in Java.</p>
  
<h3>5.11 <a name="Validation" href="#Validation">Validation</a></h3>
  
  <p>The Unicode character
  property values in the UCD files can be validated by means of regular
  expressions. Such validation can also be useful in testing of
  implementations that return property values. The method of validation
  depends on the type of property, as described below.
  These expressions use Perl syntax, but may 
  of course be converted to other formal conventions for use 
  with other regular expression engines.</p>
  
  <p>The regular expressions which are appropriate for validation
  of particular properties may change in each subsequent version of the UCD.
  However, because of stability guarantees for character property aliases, these
  regular expressions for one version of
  the Unicode Standard will match valid values for previous versions
  of the standard.</p>
  	
  <h4>5.11.1 <a name="Validation_of_Enumerated" href="#Validation_of_Enumerated">Enumerated and Binary Properties</a></h4>
  
  <p>Enumerated and binary character properties can be validated by
  generating a regular expression using the PropertyValueAliases.txt file. Because
  enumerated properties have a defined list of possible values, the validating
  regular expression simply ORs together all of the possible values. Binary properties
  are a special case of enumerated property, with a predefined very short
  list of possible values.</p>
  
  <p>For example, to validate the East_Asian_Width property in
  the UCD, or to test an implementation that returns the East_Asian_Width property,
  parse the following relevant lines from PropertyValueAliases.txt and produce a
  regular expression that concatenates each of the short and long property alias
  values.</p>

  <blockquote>  
  <pre>
# East_Asian_Width (ea)

ea ; A         ; Ambiguous

  <p>The Catalog properties, Age, Block, and Script, are another
  type of enumerated character property. All possible values of those properties
  for any given version of the Unicode Standard are listed in PropertyValueAliases.txt,
  so a validating regular expression for a Catalog property for that given version of the UCD can be
  generated by concatenating values, as for the other enumerated properties.</p>
 
  <h4>5.11.2 <a name="Validation_of_CCC" href="#Validation_of_CCC">Combining_Character_Class Property</a></h4>
  
  <p>The Combining_Character_Class (ccc) property is a hybrid type. The
  possible values defined for it in UnicodeData.txt range from 0 to 254 and are numeric
  values. However, Combining_Character_Class also has symbolic aliases defined for those particular values
  that are in actual use; those symbolic aliases are listed in PropertyValueAliases.txt.
  To produce a validating regular expression for Combining_Character_Class, concatenate
  together the symbolic aliases from PropertyValueAliases.txt, and then add the numeric
  range 0..254.</p>
  
  <p>The value 255 is reserved for use by implementations. When the
  ccc values are represented by bytes, that additional value of 255 may be used
  by an implementation for other purposes.</p>
  
  <p>The value 133 is reserved. No characters have that value. The property value alias
  CCC133 is retained in accordance with the stability policy regarding property value aliases.</p>

<h4>5.11.5 <a name="Validation_of_Multivalued" href="#Validation_of_Multivalued">Validation of Multivalued Properties</a></h4>

<p>Some properties, such as Script_Extensions of kCantonese, have property
values each consisting of a set of element values. In the data files, these element values
are separated by spaces. Validation of the property values is performed by first splitting
each set into element values at the spaces, and then validating each element value
individually. For example, the elements for Script_Extensions are values of the
Script property; they are validated according to the validation requirements for the
Script property. See also Section 5.7.6 <a href="#Property_Values_As_Sets">Properties Whose Values Are Sets of Values</a>.</p>

<p>The Name_Alias property has values which consist of sets of one or
more name strings. In the data file for this property, each element value occurs on
a separate line and can be validated as a separate element.</p>
 
<h3>5.12 <a name="Deprecation" href="#Deprecation">Deprecation</a></h3>

<p>In the Unicode Standard, the term <i>deprecation</i> is used somewhat
differently than it is in some other standards. Deprecation is used to
mean that a character or other feature is strongly discouraged from use.
This should not, however, be taken as indicating that anything has been
removed from the standard, nor that anything is <i>planned</i> for removal
from the standard. Any such change is constrained by the
Unicode Consortium Stability Policies [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Stability">Stability</a>].</p>

<p>For the Unicode Character Database, there are two important types
of deprecation to be noted. First, an <i>encoded character</i> may be
deprecated. Second, a <i>character property</i> may be deprecated.</p>

<p>When an encoded character is strongly discouraged from use, it is
given the property value Deprecated=True. The <a href="#Deprecated">Deprecated</a> property
is a binary property defined specifically to carry this information about
Unicode characters. Very few characters are ever formally
deprecated this way; it is not enough that a character be uncommon, obsolete,
disliked, or not preferred. Only those few characters which have been
determined by the UTC to have serious architectural defects or which
have been determined to cause significant implementation problems are
ever deprecated. Even in the most severe cases, such as the
deprecated format control characters (U+206A..U+206F), an encoded character
is <i>never</i> removed from the standard. Furthermore, although deprecated
characters are strongly discouraged from use, and should be avoided in
favor of other, more appropriate mechanisms, they <i>may</i> occur in data.
Conformant implementations of Unicode processes such a Unicode normalization <i>must</i>
handle even deprecated characters correctly.</p>

<p>In the Unicode Character Database, a character property may
also become strongly discouraged&#x2014;usually because it no longer
serves the purpose it was originally defined for. In such cases, the
property is labelled "deprecated" in 
<i>Table 9, <a href="#Property_List_Table">Property Table</a></i>.
For example, see the <a href="#Grapheme_Link">Grapheme_Link</a> property.
Deprecated properties are not recommended for
exposure in public APIs that support Unicode character properties.</p>

<h3>5.13 <a name="Property_APIs" href="#Property_APIs">Property APIs</a></h3>

<p>The Unicode Standard does not specify the exact form of APIs which may be defined
in software libraries to surface Unicode character properties to applications. However, there
are some recommendations and general guidelines to follow, which should serve to reduce
potential confusion and to promote better interoperability between applications using
the Unicode Character Database.</p> 
<p>In the discussion which follows here, the term <i>API</i> is
used to refer to a particular function or method, whereas the term <i>API collection</i>
is used to refer to a related group of APIs, which might constitute a set of functions
exported from a library, a class definition, or other groupings of related functionality.
A distinction is also made between a <i>public API</i>, which is exported for general
application use, and a <i>private API</i>, which may be kept hidden within a library or
class, intended for internal use.</p>

<p>First, if an API surfaces values of a particular Unicode character property
and <i>purports</i> that value to represent a Unicode character property, it should exactly
follow the specification of that property in the UCD. This principle follows from the
general approach to conformance for the Unicode Standard: If you say it is Unicode,
then it should follow the Unicode Standard specification.</p>

<p>Second, an API should be clear about which version of the UCD it
  supports. This can be done, for example, with documentation, either external or
  included in the source in header files, class definition notes, and so forth.
  For an API collection, an even better option is to include an API which explicitly
  reports which version of the UCD is supported.
  This provision should reduce confusion regarding particular property
values which might change between versions of the Unicode Standard, as well as making
it clear which repertoire of encoded characters is intended to be covered. There is
no principled constraint on an API supporting <i>more than one</i> version of the UCD, as long
as it is clear about how it does so.</p>

<p>Third, although there is no constraint on an API declaring that it
only supports a designated subset of Unicode characters, best practice for a general
purpose character property API would be to support the entire range of Unicode
code points, providing determinant and well-documented property values for any valid Unicode
code point input. That would include providing correct default property values for
any unassigned code point. See <i>Section 2.2, <a href="#Use_Default">Use of Default Values</a></i>
for an explanation of that concept.</p>

<p>Fourth, a Unicode character property API is not precluded from
extending or tailoring its support of character properties, as long as such
behavior is clearly documented, so that applications understand the values they
will be getting by calling the API. For example, an API might surface an
extended new property such as IsDanda, which is not formally part of the
properties specified by the UCD, but which can be inferred from the
documentation of the Unicode Standard. An API supporting a particular
tailoring of the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm could surface tailored
Line_Break property values to support that behavior. Alternatively, an API supporting
a particular private use agreement could surface privately-defined properties
for a designated range of PUA characters. All such use of APIs should be
considered conformant ways of extending API collections using the UCD.</p>

<p>Designers of API collections to support Unicode character properties must
also be aware that not all Unicode character properties are equal. There is no
requirement, express or implied, that <i>all</i> Unicode character properties
should be supported in a given API collection. In fact, an approach that simply parses
the UCD and surfaces <i>all</i> Unicode character properties verbatim is
very likely to result in a bad design. Character properties need to be
understood in the context of the various Unicode algorithms they are designed
to support.</p>
<p>The following subtypes of
Unicode character properties should generally <i>not</i> be exposed in APIs,
except in limited circumstances. They may not be useful, particularly
in public API collections, and may instead prove misleading to the users
of such API collections.</p>

<ul>
  <li><i><a href="#Contributory_Properties">Contributory properties</a></i> are not recommended for public APIs.</li>
  <li>A subset of Unicode normalization-related properties are not recommended for public APIs. See
    <i>Section 5.7.5, <a href="#Decompositions_and_Normalization">Decompositions and Normalization</a></i>.</li>
  <li>Deprecated properties are not recommended for public APIs. See
    <i>Section 5.12, <a href="#Deprecation">Deprecation</a></i>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.14 <a name="Character_Age" href="#Character_Age">Character Age</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="#Age">Age</a> property indicates the first version in which a
particular Unicode character was assigned. For example, U+20AC &#x20AC; EURO SIGN was
added to Version 2.1 of the Unicode Standard, so it has age=2.1, while
U+20B9 &#x20B9; INDIAN RUPEE SIGN was added to Version 6.0 of the Unicode Standard,
so it has age=6.0.</p>

<p>Formally, the Age property is a <a href="#Catalog">catalog
property</a> whose enumerated values correspond to a list of tuples consisting
of a major version integer and a minor version integer. The major version is
a positive integer constrained to the range 1..255. The minor version is a
non-negative integer constrained to the range 0..255. These range limitations
are specified so that implementations can be guaranteed that all valid,
assigned Age values can be represented in a sequence of two unsigned bytes.
A third value corresponding to the Unicode update version is not required,
because new characters are never assigned in update versions of
  the standard.</p>

<p>The short values listed in PropertyValueAliases.txt for 
  the Age property for assigned (designated) code points are of the form &quot;m.n&quot;,
  with the first field corresponding to the major version, and the second field corresponding
  to the minor version.</p> 
  <p>The long values listed in PropertyValueAliases.txt
  for the Age property for assigned code points start with 
  a &quot;V&quot; and use an underscore instead
  of a dot between the major and minor version numbers: V2_1, V6_0, and so on. This
  makes the long format more useful as an identifier in programming languages. It is
  also useful in regular expressions, where the dot has other significance.</p>

<p>The default value of the Age property, used for unassigned (undesignated) code points,
  is expressed with labels that depart from the numerical versioning scheme
  of the Age property for assigned code points; the short form for the default is &quot;NA&quot;,
  and the long form for the default is &quot;Unassigned&quot;. Implementations of parsers
  which manipulate the Age property need to be prepared for this special case,
  rather than expecting the default value to be expressed numerically, as &quot;0.0&quot;, for example.</p>

<p>The Age property is 
based on when a character is encoded in the standard. It is normative and immutable, and
cannot be meaningfully tailored.</p>

<p>The minimum value of the Age property is &quot;1.1&quot;,
  instead of &quot;1.0&quot;, because of the substantial and
  incompatible changes to the standard resulting from the merger of code points and
  character names between the Unicode Standard and ISO/IEC 10646 for their 1993
  publications. For Hangul syllable characters, which were
  extensively augmented in Unicode 2.0, the Age value is set to &quot;2.0&quot;, even
  though a subset of the Hangul syllables had been published in earlier versions,
  at different code points.</p>

<p>Private use characters, noncharacter code points, and surrogate code
  points also get Age values. The private use characters and noncharacter code
  points on the BMP have age=1.1. However, the full architecture for UTF-16 and multiple planes
  was not fully documented until Unicode 2.0, so the private use characters and
  noncharacter code points on supplementary planes, as well as the surrogate
  code points in the range D800..DFFF, are given the value age=2.0.</p>

<p>The Age property cannot be derived from the other
  data files in any single version of the Unicode Character Database. Its derivation
  is done, rather, by tools that compare the assigned characters <i>between</i>
  subsequent versions. The data file <a href="#DerivedAge.txt">DerivedAge.txt</a> 
  provides the definitive listing of the
  Age property value for all code points, as of that version of the standard.</p>

<p>The typical use case for the Age property in regular expressions
  is to search for all characters that were
  present in a given version. For this reason,
an expression such as &quot;\p{age=V3_0}&quot; is exceptionally
defined to match all of the code
points assigned in Version 3.0&#x2014;that is, all the code points with
a value <i>less than or equal to</i> the value 3.0 for the Age property, rather than 
just the subset of those code points with the value 3.0. This interprets
 &quot;\p{age=V3_0}&quot;
as the set of all characters assigned as of Unicode 3.0, rather than
as just the set of characters <i>added</i> to Unicode 3.0 subsequent to the
prior version. For more
information, see Unicode Technical Standard #18, 
"Unicode Regular Expressions" [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UTS18">UTS18</a>].</p>

to test an implementation of the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm. 
(See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX14">UAX14</a>] and [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Tests14">Tests14</a>].) The header of
that file specifies the data format and the use of the test data to
specify line break opportunities. Note that non-ASCII characters are used
in this test data as field delimiters.</p>
 
<p>There is an associated documentation file, LineBreakTest.html, which displays 
the results of the Line Breaking Algorithm in an interactive chart form, with a 
documented listing of the rules.</p>

  <p>The Unicode text segmentation test data files are also located in the 
  auxiliary directory of the UCD. (See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Tests29">Tests29</a>].) They 
  contain data which can be used to test an implementation of the segmentation 
  algorithms specified in [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX29">UAX29</a>].
  The headers of
  those file specify the data format and the use of the test data to
  specify text segmentation opportunities. Note that non-ASCII characters are used
  in this test data as field delimiters.</p>
  
  <p>There are also associated documentation 
  files, which display the results of the segmentation algorithms in an 
  interactive chart form, with a documented listing of the rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>GraphemeBreakTest.html </li>
    <li>SentenceBreakTest.html </li>
    <li>WordBreakTest.html </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Unlike the Unicode Normalization Algorithm, the Unicode Line Breaking
  Algorithm and the various text segmentation algorithms are tailorable,
  and there is every expectation that implementations will tailor these
  algorithms to produce results as needed. The test data files only test
  the <i>default</i> behavior of the algorithms. Testing of tailored implementations
  will need to modify and/or extend the test cases as appropriate to match
  any documented tailoring.</p>
  
<h3>6.3 <a name="BidiTest_txt" href="#BidiTest_txt">Bidirectional Test Files</a></h3> 

  <p>These files contain data 
  which can be used to test an implementation of the 
  Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm. 
  (See [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#UAX9">UAX9</a>] and [<a href="../tr41/tr41-28.html#Tests9">Tests9</a>].)</p>
  
  <p>The data in BidiTest.txt is intended to exhaustively test
  all possible combinations of Bidi_Class values for strings of length four or less.
  To allow for the resulting very large number of test cases,
  the data file has a somewhat complicated format which is
  described in the header. Fundamentally, for each input string and for each
  possible input paragraph level, the test data specifies the resulting bidi levels and
  expected reordering.</p>
  
  <p>The data in BidiCharacterTest.txt is provided to test various
  edge cases for the algorithm. It contains an extra field which allows for explicit
  control of the overall directional context for each test case.</p>

  <p>The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm is tailorable within certain limits. 
  Conformant implementations with no tailoring are expected to produce the results as
  specified in BidiTest.txt and BidiCharacterTest.txt, 
  and should not deviate from those results. Tailored
  implementations can also use the data in 
  the test files to test for overall conformance 
  to the algorithm by changing the assignment of properties to characters to reflect
  the details of their tailoring.</p>

  <li>VerticalOrientation.txt
    <ul>
    <li>The following two new blocks were added to the explicit list of ranges that
      default to the Vertical_Orientation property value Upright, for consistency with
      related characters: Khitan Small Script and Tangut Supplement.
      Thus, all of the code points (assigned
      characters and unassigned code points) in the two blocks were assigned the
