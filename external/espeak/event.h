/*
   Manage events (sentence, word, mark, end,...), is responsible of calling the external
   callback as soon as the relevant audio sample is played.


   The audio stream is composed of samples from synthetised messages or audio icons.
   Each event is associated to a sample.

   Scenario:

   - event_declare is called for each expected event.

   - A timeout is started for the first pending event.

   - When the timeout happens, the synth_callback is called.

   Note: the timeout is checked against the real progress of the audio stream, which depends on pauses or underruns. If the real progress is lower than the expected one, a new timeout starts.
