C***PURPOSE  Generates a uniformly distributed random number.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C      This pseudo-random number generator is portable among a wide
C variety of computers.  RAND(R) undoubtedly is not as good as many
C readily available installation dependent versions, and so this
C routine is not recommended for widespread usage.  Its redeeming
C feature is that the exact same random numbers (to within final round-
C off error) can be generated from machine to machine.  Thus, programs
C that make use of random numbers can be easily transported to and
C checked in a new environment.
C      The random numbers are generated by the linear congruential
C method described, e.g., by Knuth in Seminumerical Methods (p.9),
C Addison-Wesley, 1969.  Given the I-th number of a pseudo-random
C sequence, the I+1 -st number is generated from
C             X(I+1) = (A*X(I) + C) MOD M,
C where here M = 2**22 = 4194304, C = 1731 and several suitable values
C of the multiplier A are discussed below.  Both the multiplier A and
C random number X are represented in double precision as two 11-bit
C words.  The constants are chosen so that the period is the maximum
C possible, 4194304.
C      In order that the same numbers be generated from machine to
C machine, it is necessary that 23-bit integers be reducible modulo
C 2**11 exactly, that 23-bit integers be added exactly, and that 11-bit
C integers be multiplied exactly.  Furthermore, if the restart option
C is used (where R is between 0 and 1), then the product R*2**22 =
C R*4194304 must be correct to the nearest integer.
C      The first four random numbers should be .0004127026,
C .6750836372, .1614754200, and .9086198807.  The tenth random number
C is .5527787209, and the hundredth is .3600893021 .  The thousandth
C number should be .2176990509 .
C      In order to generate several effectively independent sequences
C with the same generator, it is necessary to know the random number
C for several widely spaced calls.  The I-th random number times 2**22,
C where I=K*P/8 and P is the period of the sequence (P = 2**22), is
C still of the form L*P/8.  In particular we find the I-th random
C number multiplied by 2**22 is given by
C I   =  0  1*P/8  2*P/8  3*P/8  4*P/8  5*P/8  6*P/8  7*P/8  8*P/8
C RAND=  0  5*P/8  2*P/8  7*P/8  4*P/8  1*P/8  6*P/8  3*P/8  0
C Thus the 4*P/8 = 2097152 random number is 2097152/2**22.
C      Several multipliers have been subjected to the spectral test
C (see Knuth, p. 82).  Four suitable multipliers roughly in order of
C goodness according to the spectral test are
C    3146757 = 1536*2048 + 1029 = 2**21 + 2**20 + 2**10 + 5
C    2098181 = 1024*2048 + 1029 = 2**21 + 2**10 + 5
C    3146245 = 1536*2048 +  517 = 2**21 + 2**20 + 2**9 + 5
C    2776669 = 1355*2048 + 1629 = 5**9 + 7**7 + 1
C
C      In the table below LOG10(NU(I)) gives roughly the number of
C random decimal digits in the random numbers considered I at a time.
C C is the primary measure of goodness.  In both cases bigger is better.

C             Input Argument --
C R      If R=0., the next random number of the sequence is generated.
C        If R .LT. 0., the last generated number will be returned for
C          possible use in a restart procedure.
C        If R .GT. 0., the sequence of random numbers will start with
C          the seed R mod 1.  This seed is also returned as the value of
C          RAND provided the arithmetic is done exactly.
C
C             Output Value --
C RAND   a pseudo-random number between 0. and 1.
