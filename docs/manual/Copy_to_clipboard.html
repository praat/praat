<p>A command in the File menu of the <a href="Picture_window.html">Picture window</a> on Windows and Macintosh.</p>
<p>It copies the selected part of the picture to the clipboard. You can then <b>Paste</b> it into any program that knows how to display pictures.</p>
<h2>Behaviour</h2>
<p>Though all the picture data will be written to the clipboard, only the part that corresponds to the selected part of the Picture window (the <i>viewport</i>) will be visible.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>On Windows, if you have a PostScript printer, you may want to use <a href="Save_as_EPS_file___.html">Save as EPS file...</a> instead (experiment with the results after converting to PDF or printing). If the picture is too large, e.g. a spectrogram that does not seem to fit into the clipboard, you can try <a href="Save_as_Windows_metafile___.html">Save as Windows metafile...</a> instead.</p>
<p>On the Mac, the picture will be put on the clipboard in PDF format, which is recognized by programs that know how to handle PDF pictures, such as Microsoft<sup>&#174;</sup> Word&#8482; 2008; the quality of the picture will be exactly as good as when you use <a href="Save_as_PDF_file___.html">Save as PDF file...</a> and read in the resulting PDF file. Please realize that Word will convert the PDF picture to a mediocre 300-dpi bitmap if you save the document as a <b>.doc</b> file; therefore, you should save the document as a <b>.docx</b> file instead. If you cannot work with <b>.docx</b> files (for instance because your publisher does not accept that file type yet), consider using <a href="Save_as_EPS_file___.html">Save as EPS file...</a> instead. In older programs, such as Microsoft<sup>&#174;</sup> Word&#8482; 2004, you cannot paste Praat's PDF pictures; use <a href="Save_as_EPS_file___.html">Save as EPS file...</a> instead.</p>
