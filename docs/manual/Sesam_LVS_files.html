<p>A way for storing a <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> object on disk.</p>
<h2>File format</h2>
<p>The sound files used by the SESAM and LVS programs. Each sample is normally quantized into 12 bits.</p>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>To read a <b>Sound</b> from a Sesam file on disk, use <a href="Read_from_file___.html">Read from file...</a>. The file name is expected to end in ".sdf" or ".SDF".</p>
<p>The 12-bit sample values are divided by 2048 so that the amplitude of the resulting Sound is between -1.0 and +1.0.</p>
<p>The resulting <b>Sound</b> will appear in the List of Objects; its name will be equal to the file name, without extension.</p>
<p>If the sound was encoded in 16 bits per sample, you should divide by 16 after reading (with <code><font size=+1>Formula: ~ self / 16</font></code>)</p>
<h2>Saving</h2>
<p>With <b>Save as Sesam file...</b>. Praat then asks you for a file name. After you click OK, the samples of the Sound are multiplied by 2048 and quantized between -2048 and 2047; the result is written to the file in 12-bit LVS and Sesam format.</p>
<p>To avoid clipping, keep the absolute amplitude below 1.000. If the maximum sound pressure level is 91 dB (top = 2047), the quantization threshold is (top = 1/2) 19 dB.</p>
<p>If you prefer 16-bit encoding, you should multiply by 16 before saving (with <code><font size=+1>Formula: ~ self * 16</font></code>)</p>
