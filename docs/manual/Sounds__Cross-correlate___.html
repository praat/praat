<p>A command available in the <b>Combine</b> menu when you select two <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> objects. This command cross-correlates two selected <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> objects with each other. As a result, a new Sound will appear in the list of objects; this new Sound is the <i>cross</i>-correlation of the two original Sounds.</p>

<dt><b>Amplitude scaling</b>
<dd>Here you can choose between the &#8220;principled&#8221; options <b>integral</b>, <b>sum</b>, and <b>normalize</b>, which are explained in 1, 2 and 3 below. There is also a &#8220;pragmatic&#8221; option, namely <b>peak 0.99</b>, which scales the resulting sound in such a way that its absolute peak becomes 0.99, so that the sound tends to be clearly audible without distortion when you play it (see <a href="Sound__Scale_peak___.html">Sound: Scale peak...</a>).</dd>
<dt><b>Signal outside time domain is...</b>
<dd>Here you can choose whether outside their time domains the sounds are considered to be <b>zero</b> (the standard value), or <b>similar</b> to the sounds within the time domains. This is explained in 4 below.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>1. Cross-correlation as an integral</h2>
<p>The cross-correlation of two continuous time signals <i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) and <i>g</i>(<i>t</i>) is a function of the lag time <i></i> a, and defined as the <b>integral</b></p>
<table width="100%" style="white-space:pre-wrap"><tr><td align=middle>cross-corr (<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>) (<i>&#964;</i>) &#8801; &#8747; <i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) <i>g</i>(<i>t</i>+<i>&#964;</i>) <i>dt</i></table>
<p>If <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> are sampled signals (as Sounds are in Praat), with the same <a href="sampling_period.html">sampling period</a> <i> et</i>, the definition is discretized as</p>
<table width="100%" style="white-space:pre-wrap"><tr><td align=middle>cross-corr (<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>) [<i>&#964;</i>] &#8801; &#8721;<sub><i>t</i></sub> <i>f</i>[<i>t</i>] <i>g</i>[<i>t</i>+<i>&#964;</i>] <i>&#916;t</i></table>
<p>where <i>&#964;</i> and <i>t</i>+<i>&#964;</i> are the discrete times at which <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> are defined, respectively.</p>
<p>Cross-correlation is not a commutative operation, i.e. cross-corr (<i>g</i>, <i>f</i>) equals the time reversal of cross-corr (<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>). This means that the order in which you put the two Sounds in the object list does matter: the two results are each other's time reversals.</p>
<h2>2. Cross-correlation as a sum</h2>
<p>You can see in the formula above that if both input Sounds are expressed in units of Pa, the resulting Sound should ideally be expressed in Pa<sup>2</sup>s. Nevertheless, Praat will express it in Pa, because Sounds cannot be expressed otherwise.</p>
<p>This basically means that it is impossible to get the amplitude of the resulting Sound correct for all purposes. For this reason, Praat considers a different definition of cross-correlation as well, namely as the <b>sum</b></p>
<table width="100%" style="white-space:pre-wrap"><tr><td align=middle>cross-corr (<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>) [<i>&#964;</i>] &#8801; &#8721;<sub><i>t</i></sub> <i>f</i>[<i>t</i>] <i>g</i>[<i>t</i>+<i>&#964;</i>]</table>
<p>The difference between the integral and sum definitions is that in the sum definition the resulting sound is divided by <i>&#916;t</i>.</p>
<h2>3. Normalized cross-correlation</h2>
<p>The <i>normalized cross-correlation</i> is defined as</p>
<table width="100%" style="white-space:pre-wrap"><tr><td align=middle>norm-cross-corr (<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>) (<i>&#964;</i>) &#8801; &#8747; <i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) <i>g</i>(<i>t</i>+<i>&#964;</i>) <i>dt</i> / &#8730; (&#8747; <i>f</i><sup>2</sup>(<i>t</i>) <i>dt</i> &#8747; <i>g</i><sup>2</sup>(<i>t</i>) <i>dt</i>)</table>
<h2>4. Shape scaling</h2>
<p>The boundaries of the integral in 1 are &#8722;&#8734; and +&#8734;. However, <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> are Sound objects in Praat and therefore have finite time domains. If <i>f</i> runs from <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> to <i>t</i><sub>2</sub> and is assumed to be <b>zero</b> before <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> and after <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, and <i>g</i> runs from <i>t</i><sub>3</sub> to <i>t</i><sub>4</sub> and is assumed to be zero outside that domain, then the cross-correlation will be zero before <i>t</i><sub>3</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>2</sub> and after <i>t</i><sub>4</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, while between <i>t</i><sub>3</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>2</sub> and <i>t</i><sub>4</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> it is</p>
<table width="100%" style="white-space:pre-wrap"><tr><td align=middle>cross-corr (<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>) (<i>&#964;</i>) = &#8747;<sub><i>t1</i></sub><sup><i>t2</i></sup> <i>f</i>(<i>t</i>) <i>g</i>(<i>t</i>+<i>&#964;</i>) <i>dt</i></table>
<p>In this formula, the argument of <i>f</i> runs from <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> to <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, but the argument of <i>g</i> runs from <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>+(<i>t</i><sub>3</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>2</sub>) to <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>+(<i>t</i><sub>4</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>), i.e. from <i>t</i><sub>3</sub>&#8722;(<i>t</i><sub>2</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>) to <i>t</i><sub>4</sub>+(<i>t</i><sub>2</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>). This means that the integration is performed over two equal stretches of time during which <i>g</i> must be taken zero, namely a time stretch before <i>t</i><sub>3</sub> and a time stretch after <i>t</i><sub>4</sub>, both of duration <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> (equivalent equations can be formulated that rely on two stretches of <i>t</i><sub>4</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>3</sub> of zeroes in <i>f</i> rather than in <i>g</i>, or on a stretch of <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> of zeroes in <i>g</i> and a stretch of <i>t</i><sub>4</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>3</sub> of zeroes in <i>f</i>.</p>
<p>If you consider the sounds outside their time domains as <b>similar</b> to what they are within their time domains, instead of <b>zero</b>, the discretized formula in 1 should be based on the average over the jointly defined values of <i>f</i>[<i>&#964;</i>] and <i>g</i>[<i>t</i>&#8722;<i>&#964;</i>], without counting any multiplications of values outside the time domains. Suppose that <i>f</i> is defined on the time domain [0, 1.2] with the value of 1 everywhere, and <i>g</i> is defined on the time domain [0, 3] with the value 1 everywhere. Their cross-correlation under the assumption that they are <b>zero</b> elsewhere is then</p>
<code>   short = Create Sound from formula: "short", 1, 0.0, 1.2, 1000, ~ 1<br></code>
<code>   long = Create Sound from formula: "long", 1, 0.0, 3.0, 1000, ~ 1<br></code>
<code>   plusObject: short<br></code>
<code>   Cross-correlate: "integral", "zero"<br></code>

<p align=middle><img height=300 width=500 src=Sounds__Cross-correlate____1.png></p><p>but under the assumption that the sounds are <b>similar</b> (i.e. 1) elsewhere, their cross-correlation should be</p>

<code>   Draw: 0, 0, 0.0, 1.5, "yes", "curve"<br></code>
<code>   One mark left: 1.2, "yes", "yes", "yes", ""<br></code>
<p align=middle><img height=300 width=500 src=Sounds__Cross-correlate____2.png></p><p>i.e. a constant value of 1.2. This is what you get by choosing the <b>similar</b> option; if <i>f</i> is shorter than <i>g</i>, the first and last parts of the cross-correlation will be divided by a straight line of duration <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> to compensate for the fact that the cross-correlation has been computed over fewer values of <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> there.</p>
<h2>5. Behaviour</h2>
<p>The start time of the resulting Sound will be the start time of <i>f</i> minus the end time of <i>g</i>, the end time of the resulting Sound will be the end time of <i>f</i> minus the start time of <i>g</i>, the time of the first sample of the resulting Sound will be the first sample of <i>f</i> minus the last sample of <i>g</i>, the time of the last sample of the resulting Sound will be the last sample of <i>f</i> minus the first sample of <i>g</i>, and the number of samples in the resulting Sound will be the sum of the numbers of samples of <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> minus 1.</p>
<h2>6. Behaviour for stereo and other multi-channel sounds</h2>
<p>You can cross-correlate e.g. a 10-channel sound either with another 10-channel sound or with a 1-channel (mono) sound.</p>
<p>If both Sounds have more than one channel, the two Sounds have to have the same number of channels; each channel of the resulting Sound is then computed as the cross-correlation of the corresponding channels of the original Sounds. For instance, if you cross-correlate two 10-channel sounds, the resulting sound will have 10 channels, and its 9th channel will be the cross-correlation of the 9th channels of the two original sounds.</p>
<p>If one of the original Sounds has multiple channels and the other Sound has only one channel, the resulting Sound will have multiple channels; each of these is computed as the cross-correlation of the corresponding channel of the multiple-channel original and the single channel of the single-channel original. For instance, if you cross-correlate a 10-channel sound with a mono sound, the resulting sound will have 10 channels, and its 9th channel will be the cross-correlation of the mono sound with the 9th channel of the original 10-channel sound.</p>
<p>The amplitude scaling factor will be the same for all channels, so that the relative amplitude of the channels will be preserved in the resulting sound. For the <b>normalize</b> scaling, for instance, the norm of <i>f</i> in the formula above is taken over all channels of <i>f</i>. For the <b>peak 0.99</b> scaling, the resulting sound will typically have an absolute peak of 0.99 in only one channel, and lower absolute peaks in the other channels.</p>
<h2>7. Algorithm</h2>
<p>The computation makes use of the fact that cross-correlation in the time domain corresponds to multiplication of the time-reversal of <i>f</i> with <i>g</i> in the frequency domain: we first pad <i>f</i> with a stretch of <i>t</i><sub>4</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>3</sub> of zeroes and <i>g</i> with a stretch of <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>1</sub> of zeroes (see 4 above), so that both sounds obtain a duration of (<i>t</i><sub>2</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>) + (<i>t</i><sub>4</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>3</sub>); we then calculate the spectra of the two zero-padded sounds by Fourier transformation, then multiply the complex conjugate of the spectrum of <i>f</i> with the spectrum of <i>g</i>, and finally Fourier-transform the result of this multiplication back to the time domain; the result will again have a duration of (<i>t</i><sub>2</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>) + (<i>t</i><sub>4</sub>&#8722;<i>t</i><sub>3</sub>).</p>
