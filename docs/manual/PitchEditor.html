<p>One of the <a href="Editors.html">Editors</a> in Praat, for viewing and modifying a <a href="Pitch.html">Pitch</a> object.</p>
<h2>What the Pitch editor shows</h2>
<p>In the window of the PitchEditor, you will see the following features:</p>
<dl>
<dd style="position:relative;padding-left:1em;text-indent:-2em">&#8226; Digits between 0 and 9 scattered all over the drawing area. Their locations represent the pitch <i><b>candidates</i></b>, of which there are several for every time frame. The digits themselves represent the goodness of a candidate, multiplied by ten. For instance, if you see a "9" at the location (1.23 seconds, 189 hertz), this means that in the time frame at 1.23 seconds, there is a pitch candidate with a value of 189 hertz, and its goodness is 0.9. The number 0.9 may be the relative height of an autocorrelation peak, a cross-correlation peak, or a spectral peak, depending on the method by which the Pitch object was computed.</dd>
<dd style="position:relative;padding-left:1em;text-indent:-2em">&#8226; A <i><b>path</i></b> of red disks. These disks represent the best path through the candidates, i.e. our best guess at what the pitch contour is. The path will usually have been determined by the <i>path finder</i>, which was called by the pitch-extraction algorithm, and you can change the path manually. The path finder takes into account the goodness of each candidate, the intensity of the sound in the frame, voiced-unvoiced transitions, and frequency jumps. It also determines whether each frame is voiced or unvoiced.</dd>
<dd style="position:relative;padding-left:1em;text-indent:-2em">&#8226; A <i><b>voicelessness bar</i></b> at the bottom of the drawing area. If there is no suitable pitch candidate in a frame, the frame is considered voiceless, which is shown as a blue rectangle in the voicelessness bar.</dd>
<dd style="position:relative;padding-left:1em;text-indent:-2em">&#8226; A line of digits between 0 and 9 along the top. These represent the relative intensity of the sound in each frame.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Moving the marks</h2>
<p>To move the cursor hair or the beginning or end of the selection, use the <a href="time_selection.html">time selection</a> mechanism.</p>
<h2>Changing the path</h2>
<p>To change the path through the candidates manually, click on the candidates of your choice. The changes will immediately affect the Pitch object that you are editing. To make a voiced frame voiceless, click in the voicelessness bar.</p>
<p>To change the path automatically, choose <b>Path finder...</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu; this will have the same effect as filling in different values in the <a href="Sound__To_Pitch__filtered_autocorrelation____.html">Sound: To Pitch (filtered autocorrelation)...</a> or <a href="Sound__To_Pitch__raw_autocorrelation____.html">Sound: To Pitch (raw autocorrelation)...</a> command window, but is much faster because the candidates do not have to be determined again.</p>
<h2>Resynthesis</h2>
<p>To hum any part of the pitch contour, click one of the buttons below or above the data area (there can be 1 to 8 of these buttons), or use a command from the <b>Play</b> menu.</p>
<h2>Changing the ceiling</h2>
<p>To change the ceiling, but not the path, choose <b>Change ceiling...</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu; if the new ceiling is lower than the old ceiling, some formerly voiced frames may become unvoiced; if the new ceiling is higher than the old ceiling, some formerly unvoiced frames may become voiced.</p>
