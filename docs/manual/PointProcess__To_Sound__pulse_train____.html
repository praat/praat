PointProcess: To Sound (pulse train)...

<p>A command to convert every selected <a href="PointProcess.html">PointProcess</a> into a <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a>.</p>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p>A pulse is generated at every point in the point process. This pulse is filtered at the Nyquist frequency of the resulting <b>Sound</b> by converting it into a sampled <b>sinc</b> function.</p>
<h2>Settings</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>Sampling frequency (Hz)</b>
<dd>the sampling frequency of the resulting Sound object, e.g. 44100 hertz.</dd>
<dt><b>Adaptation factor</b>
<dd>the factor by which a pulse height will be multiplied if the pulse time is not within <b>Adaptation time</b> from the pre-previous pulse, and by which a pulse height will again be multiplied if the pulse time is not within <b>Adaptation time</b> from the previous pulse. This factor is against abrupt starts of the pulse train after silences, and is 1.0 if you do want abrupt starts after silences.</dd>
<dt><b>Adaptation time (s)</b>
<dd>the minimal period that will be considered a silence, e.g. 0.05 seconds.</dd>
<dt><b>Interpolation depth</b>
<dd>the extent of the sinc function to the left and to the right of the peak, e.g. 2000 samples.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Example: if <b>Adaptation factor</b> is 0.6, and <b>Adaptation time</b> is 0.02 s, then the heights of the first two pulses after silences of at least 20 ms will be multiplied by 0.36 and 0.6, respectively.</p>
