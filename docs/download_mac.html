Downloading Praat for Macintosh
</b></font></table></table>

<hr><h3>1. Downloading the Macintosh edition</h3>
<p>To download the latest version of the <b>MacOS</b> edition of <b>Praat</b>,
click once on the following disk image file:</p>
<dl>
<dd>64-bit edition (MacOS 10.11-10.15 and macOS 11-15, for Intel and Apple Silicon): <b><a href="https://github.com/praat/praat/releases/download/v6.4.38/praat6438_mac.dmg">praat6438_mac.dmg</a></b> (1 July 2025; 46.0 MB)
</dl>
<p>After downloading, your web browser might open the <b>.dmg</b> file directly; you will then see the program <b>Praat</b> or <b>Praat.app</b>.
If your browser did not open the <b>.dmg</b> file,
then you should double-click the <b>.dmg</b> file in the <b>Downloads</b> window (or in the <b>Downloads</b> folder in your home directory);
after double-clicking you may see the program <b>Praat</b> or <b>Praat.app</b> directly,
or you may see a disk icon called <b>Praat6438</b>, which when you open it will show you the program <b>Praat</b> or <b>Praat.app</b>.
To install Praat, just drag the program <b>Praat</b> or <b>Praat.app</b> to your <b>Applications</b> folder (or anywhere else).</p>

<hr><h3>2. How to start</h3>
<p>To start up the Praat program, just double-click it.
If you use Praat for the first time, choose <b>Intro</b> from the Help menu.</p>
<p><b>If you have trouble starting Praat for the first time:</b><br>
To protect you against harmful software, MacOS enforces increasingly severe security measures,
initially trusting only apps that you downloaded from the App Store.
This is a good thing, but it does make it increasingly difficult to start up reliable applications
that you download from outside the App Store, such as Praat.
Your Mac can throw a variety of messages at you:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your Mac says “Praat.app is an application downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?”,
you can just click Open.
<li>If your Mac says
“Your security settings allow you to install only apps that you downloaded from the App Store”,
then you go to the Apple menu -> System Preferences -> Security &amp; Privacy, and set “Allow apps downloaded from:”
to “App Store and identified developers” (you may have to “click the lock” to make this change).
After this, you should be fine, because the Praat app has been “signed” by us,
and we are indeed certified Mac developers.
<li>If your Mac says “Praat cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer;
your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the App Store and identified developers”,
than your Mac may not have access to the Internet to check our credentials,
but you should still be able to open Praat by clicking on the Praat icon with the right-hand mouse button
(or with ctrl-click if your mouse has only one button) and choosing Open.
<li>If your Mac says “Praat cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software;
this software needs to be updated; contact the developer for more information”,
than this means that Apple has somehow not managed to “notarize” Praat,
but you should still be able to open Praat by going to Apple menu -> System Preferences -> Security &amp; Privacy,
seeing the message “Praat was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer”, and clicking “Open anyway”
(you may have to “click the lock to make changes”).
</ul>

<hr><h3>3. Phonetic symbols</h3>
<p>If you want to see good-quality phonetic characters on your screen and in your clipboard,
you have to install the Charis and/or the Doulos SIL font.
These fonts were created by the <a href="https://www.sil.org">Summer Institute of Linguistics</a>.
To install them, first download the archives:
<dl>
<dd><b><a href="Charis-7.000.zip">Charis-7.000.zip</a></b> (February 2025)
<dd><b><a href="DoulosSIL-7.000.zip">DoulosSIL-7.000.zip</a></b> (February 2025)
</dl>
<p>Then unpack the <b>.zip</b> files, if your web browser has not already done that.
This will give you folders called <b>Charis-7.000</b> and <b>DoulosSIL-7.000</b>.
When you open these folders, you will see TrueType fonts such as
<b>Charis-Regular.ttf</b>, <b>Charis-Bold.ttf</b>, <b>Charis-Italic.ttf</b>, and <b>Charis-BoldItalic.ttf</b>, and <b>DoulosSIL-Regular.ttf</b>.
For each of these five fonts, double-click it, wait for the Font Book window to appear, and then click Install Font.</p>

<hr><h3>4. Problems with sound</h3>
<p><b>Recording.</b> If your recorded sound is all zeroes,
then you may have disallowed Praat to access the microphone; in that case,
go to System Preferences -> Security &amp; Privacy -> Microphone and put a check mark next to the Praat symbol.</p>
<p><b>Playing on macOS 11 BigSur or macOS 12 Monterey.</b> If there is a click or crack at the end of a sound,
go to Praat -> Preferences -> Sound playing preferences, and set Silence After to 0.5 seconds or so.</p>
<p><b>Playing on macOS 10.14 or 10.15.</b> It is possible that your sounds play terribly, with cracks, repetitions and pauses.
A likely cause is a macOS bug that you can solve: open Audio MIDI Setup (in Applications -> Utilities),
go to MacBook internal loudspeakers (or so) -> Output, change the Format from 48000 Hz to 44100 Hz,
and play a sound again in Praat, which should now sound correctly. Even though your Mac
will change this setting back to 48000 Hz, sound output is likely to continue to sound correctly.</p>

<hr><h3>5. Tuning Praat to your Macintosh</h3>
<p>Sounds are recorded into a buffer whose size you can set with “Sound recording preferences”.</p>
<p>The best way to produce pictures is to use the clipboard or “Save as PDF file...”
in the Picture window.
Both the clipboard and “Save as PDF file...” produce PDF pictures.
Most word-processing programs newer than 2006 accept such PDF pictures, at least on the Mac;
if you use Microsoft Word 2008 or later, make sure to save your document as a <b>.docx</b> file,
because if you save it as a <b>.doc</b> file, Word will convert the inserted PDF pictures into mediocre bitmaps.</p>

<hr><h3>6. Running Praat from the command line</h3>
<p>To run Praat from a terminal window,
write a Praat script and specify that script on the command line, optionally with arguments, e.g.:</p>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/Applications/Praat.app/Contents/MacOS/Praat --run playsinewave.praat 377 0.9</code>
<p>For details see <a href="manual/Scripting_6_9__Calling_from_the_command_line.html">Calling from the command line</a> in the Scripting manual.</p>

<hr><h3>7. Editions of Praat for older computers or operating system versions</h3>
<p>On a modern computer you would use <a href="https://github.com/praat/praat/releases/download/v6.4.38/praat6438_mac.dmg">Praat 6.4.38</a>, as suggested above.
If that does not work on your computer, you can probably try an older version:</p>
