INTRO (U"A command that creates a @Formant object from every selected @Sound object. "
	"It performs a short-term spectral analysis, approximating the spectrum of each "
	"analysis frame by a number of formants.")
ENTRY (U"Settings")
TAG (U"##Time step (s)")
DEFINITION (U"the time between the centres of consecutive analysis frames. If the sound is 2 seconds long, "
	"and the time step is 0.01 seconds, there will be approximately 200 analysis frames. "
	"The actual number is somewhat lower (usually 195), because we cannot measure very well "
	"near the edges. If you set the time step to 0.0 (the standard), Praat will use a time step "
	"that is equal to 25 percent of the analysis window length (see below).")
TAG (U"##Maximum number of formants")
DEFINITION (U"for most analyses of human speech, you will want to extract 5 formants per frame. "
	"This, in combination with the ##Maximum formant# setting, is the only way "
	"in which this procedure will give you results compatible with how people "
	"tend to interpret formants for vowels, i.e. in terms of "
	"vowel height (F1) and vowel place (F2). Otherwise, the ##Maximum number of formants# can be any multiple of 0.5, "
	"you can choose 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, and so on (see below).")
TAG (U"##Maximum formant (Hz)")
DEFINITION (U"the ceiling of the formant search range, in hertz. It is crucial that you set this to a value suitable for your speaker. "
	"An average adult female speaker has a vocal tract length that requires an average ceiling of 5500 Hz (which is Praat's standard value), "
	"an average adult male speaker has a vocal tract length that requires an average ceiling of 5000 Hz, "
	"and a young child may have a vocal tract length that requires an average ceiling of 8000 Hz. "
	"These are just examples; there is large variation between speakers, "
	"and @@Escudero, Boersma, Rauber & Bion (2009)@ showed that the vocal tract length difference "
	"between a person's front vowels and their back vowels may be greater "
	"than the average vocal tract length difference between males and females. "
	"If you choose a too high ceiling, you may end up with too few formants in the low frequency region, "
	"e.g. analysing an [u] as having a single formant near 500 Hz whereas you want two formants at 300 and 600 Hz. "
	"You may like to experiment with this setting on steady vowels.")
TAG (U"##Window length (s)")
DEFINITION (U"the effective duration of the analysis window, in seconds. The actual length is twice this value, "
	"because Praat uses a Gaussian-like analysis window with sidelobes below -120 dB. "
	"For instance, if the ##Window length# is 0.025 seconds, the actual Gaussian window duration "
	"is 0.050 seconds. This window has values below 4\\%  outside the central 0.025 seconds, "
	"and its frequency resolution (-3 dB point) is 1.298 / (0.025 s) = 51.9 Hz, as computed "
	"with the formula given at @@Sound: To Spectrogram...@. This is comparable to the bandwidth "
	"of a Hamming window of 0.025 seconds, which is 1.303 / (0.025 s) = 52.1 Hz, "
	"but that window (which is the window most often used in other analysis programs) "
	"has three spectral lobes of about -42 dB on each side.")
TAG (U"##Pre-emphasis from (Hz)")
DEFINITION (U"the +3 dB point for an inverted low-pass filter with a slope of +6 dB/octave. "
	"If this value is 50 Hz, then frequencies below 50 Hz are not enhanced, "
	"frequencies around 100 Hz are amplified by 6 dB, frequencies around 200 Hz are amplified by 12 dB, "
	"and so forth. The point of this is that vowel spectra tend to fall by 6 dB per octave; "
	"the pre-emphasis creates a flatter spectrum, which is better for formant analysis "
	"because we want our formants to match the local peaks, not the global spectral slope. "
	"See the @@source-filter synthesis@ tutorial for a technical explanation, "
	"and @@Sound: Pre-emphasize (in-place)...@ for the algorithm.")
ENTRY (U"Algorithm")
NORMAL (U"The sound will be resampled to a sampling frequency of twice the value of %%Maximum formant%, "
	"with the algorithm described at @@Sound: Resample...@. "
	"After this, pre-emphasis is applied with the algorithm described at @@Sound: Pre-emphasize (in-place)...@. "
	"For each analysis window, Praat applies a Gaussian-like window, "
	"and computes the LPC coefficients with the algorithm by Burg, as given by @@Childers (1978)@ "
	"and @@Press et al. (1992)@. The number of \"poles\" that this algorithm computes is twice the %%Maximum number of formants%; "
	"that's why you can set the %%Maximum number of formants% to any multiple of 0.5).")
NORMAL (U"The algorithm will initially find ##Maximum number of formants# formants in the whole range between 0 Hz "
	"and ##Maximum formant#. The initially found formants can therefore sometimes have very low frequencies (near 0 Hz) "
	"or very high frequencies (near ##Maximum formant#). Such low or high \"formants\" tend to be artefacts of the LPC algorithm, "
	"i.e., the algorithm tends to use them to match the spectral slope if that slope differs from the 6 dB/octave assumption. "
	"Therefore, such low or high \"formants\" cannot usually be associated with the vocal tract resonances that you are looking for. "
	"In order for you to be able to identify the traditional F1 and F2, "
	"all formants below 50 Hz and all formants above ##Maximum formant# minus 50 Hz, "
	"are therefore removed. If you don't want this removal, you may experiment with @@Sound: To Formant (keep all)...@ instead. "
	"If you prefer an algorithm that always yields the requested number of formants, nicely distributed "
	"across the frequency domain, you may try the otherwise rather unreliable Split-Levinson procedure @@Sound: To Formant (sl)...@.")
