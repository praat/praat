NORMAL (U"#Question: what algorithm is used for pitch analysis?")
NORMAL (U"Answer: see @@Sound: To Pitch (ac)...@. The 1993 article is downloadable from "
	"http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/paul/")
NORMAL (U"#Question: why does Praat consider my sound voiceless while I hear it as voiced?")
NORMAL (U"There are at least five possibilities. Most of them can be checked by zooming in on the @waveform.")
NORMAL (U"The first possibility is that the pitch has fallen below the @@pitch floor@. For instance, "
	"your pitch floor could be 75 Hz but the English speaker produces creak at the end of the utterance. "
	"Or your pitch floor could be 75 Hz but the Chinese speaker is in the middle of a third tone. "
	"If this happens, it may help to lower the pitch floor to e.g. 40 Hz (@@Pitch settings...@), "
	"although that may also smooth the pitch curve too much in other places.")
NORMAL (U"The second possibility is that the pitch has moved too fast. This could happen at the end of a Chinese fourth tone, "
	"which drops very fast. If this happens, it may help to use the \"optimize for voice analysis\" setting, "
	"(@@Pitch settings...@), although Praat may then hallucinate pitches in other places that you would prefer to consider voiceless.")
NORMAL (U"The third possibility is that the periods are very irregular, as in some pathological voices. "
	"If you want to see a pitch in those cases, it may help to use the \"optimize for voice analysis\" setting "
	"(@@Pitch settings...@). Or it may help to lower the \"voicing threshold\" setting (@@Advanced pitch settings...@) "
	"to 0.25 (instead of the standard 0.45) or so.")
NORMAL (U"The fourth possibility is that there is a lot of background noise, as in a recording on a busy street. "
	"In such a case, it may help to lower the \"voicing threshold\" setting (@@Advanced pitch settings...@) "
	"to 0.25 (instead of the standard 0.45) or so. The disadvantage of lowering this setting is that for non-noisy "
	"recordings, Praat will become too eager to find voicing in some places that you would prefer to consider voiceless; "
	"so make sure to set it back to 0.45 once you have finished analysing the noisy recordings.")
NORMAL (U"The fifth possibility is that the part analysed as voiceless is much less loud than the rest of the sound, "
	"or that the sound contains a loud noise elsewhere. This can be checked by zooming in on the part analysed as voiceless: "
	"if Praat suddenly considers it as voiced, this is a sign that this part is much quieter than the rest. "
	"To make Praat analyse this part as voiced, you can lower the \"silence threshold\" setting to 0.01 "
	"(instead of the standard 0.03) or so. The disadvantage of lowering this setting is that Praat may start to consider "
	"some distant background sounds (and quiet echos, for instance) as voiced.")
NORMAL (U"#Question: why do I get different results for the maximum pitch if...?")
NORMAL (U"If you select a Sound and choose @@Sound: To Pitch...@, the time step will usually "
	"be 0.01 seconds. The resulting @Pitch object will have values for times that are "
	"0.01 seconds apart. If you then click Info or choose ##Get maximum pitch# from the #Query menu, "
	"the result is based on those time points. By contrast, if you choose ##Get maximum pitch# "
	"from the #Pitch menu in the SoundEditor window, the result will be based on the visible points, "
	"of which there tend to be a hundred in the visible window. These different time spacings will "
	"lead to slightly different pitch contours.")
NORMAL (U"If you choose ##Move cursor to maximum pitch#, then choose ##Get pitch# from the "
	"#%Pitch menu, the result will be different again. This is because ##Get maximum pitch# "
	"can do a parabolic interpolation around the maximum, whereas ##Get pitch#, not realizing "
	"that the cursor is at a maximum, does a stupid linear interpolation, which tends to lead to "
	"lower values.")

	"For instance, if Praat wants to know the spectrum at 1.342 seconds, it needs to include information "
	"about the signal in a 10-milliseconds window around this time point, i.e., Praat will use "
	"signal information about all times between 1.337 and 1.347 seconds. At the very edges of the sound, "

	"if the sound runs from 0 to 1.8 seconds, no spectrum can be computed between 0 and 0.005 "

	"But Praat did not forget what the signal looks like just outside the edges of this time window. "
	"To display a spectrogram from 0.45 to 1.35 seconds, Praat will use information from the wave form "
	"between 0.445 and 1.355 seconds, and if this is available, you will see no white stripes at the edges of the window.")
ENTRY (U"Hey, it changes when I scroll!")
NORMAL (U"This is normal as well, especially for long windows. If your visible time window is 20 seconds long, "

	"then you might think that every one-pixel-wide vertical line should represent the spectrum of 20 milliseconds of sound. "
	"But for reasons of computation speed, Praat will only show the spectrum of the part of the sound "
	"that lies around the centre of those 20 milliseconds, "
	"not the average or sum of all the spectra in those 20 milliseconds. "
	"This %undersampling of the underlying spectrogram is different from what happens in the drawing of the wave form, "
	"where a vertical black line connects the minimum and maximum amplitude of all the samples that fall inside a "
	"screen pixel. We cannot do something similar for spectrograms. And since scrolling goes by fixed time steps "
	"(namely, 5 percent of the duration of the visible window), rather than by a whole number of screen pixels, "
	"the centres of the pixels will fall in different parts of the spectrogram with each scroll. "
	"Hence the apparent changes. If your visible window is shorter than a couple of seconds, "
	"the scrolling spectrogram will appear much smoother.")
NORMAL (U"The darkness of the spectrogram will also change when you scroll, because the visible part with the most "

	"The relative extent to which each sample contributes to the spectrum is given by the window shape. "
	"You can choose from: Gaussian, Square (none, rectangular), Hamming (raised sine-squared), "
	"Bartlett (triangular), Welch (parabolic), and Hanning (sine-squared). "
	"The Gaussian window is superior, as it gives no %sidelobes in your spectrogram (see below); "
	"it analyzes a factor of 2 slower than the other window shapes, "
	"because the analysis is actually performed on twice as many samples per frame.")

ENTRY (U"The %%pitch range% setting")
NORMAL (U"This is the most important setting for pitch analysis. The standard range is from 75 to 500 hertz, "

	"The range that you set here will be shown to the right of the analysis window.")
NORMAL (U"You should set the range to values appropriate for your speaker, "
	"but a problem is that speakers vary enormously in their pitch ranges. "
	"For many low-pitched (e.g. average male) voices, you may want to set the floor to 75 Hz, and the ceiling to 300 Hz; "
	"for many high-pitched (e.g. average female) voices, a range of 100-500 Hz may instead be appropriate. "
	"On the high side, some children can reach almost 2000 Hz when yelling; "
	"on the low side, creaky voice can go as low as 40 Hz; "
	"for the speakers you are investigating, you may therefore want to experiment with this setting.")
NORMAL (U"Here is why you have to supply these settings. If the pitch floor is 75 Hz, "
	"the pitch analysis method requires a 40-millisecond analysis window, "
	"i.e., in order to measure the F0 at a time of, say, 0.850 seconds, "
	"Praat needs to consider a part of the sound that runs from 0.830 to 0.870 seconds. "
	"These 40 milliseconds correspond to 3 maximum pitch periods (3/75 = 0.040). "
	"If you set the pitch floor down to 25 Hz, the analysis window will grow to 120 milliseconds "
	"(which is again 3 maximum pitch periods), i.e., all times between 0.790 and 0.910 seconds will be considered. "
	"This makes it less easy to see fast F0 changes.")
NORMAL (U"So setting the floor of the pitch range is a technical requirement for the pitch analysis. "
