MAN_BEGIN (U"FAQ: Pitch analysis", U"ppgb", 20231115)   // 20221202
NORMAL (U"Please also consult @@How to choose a pitch analysis method@.")
NORMAL (U"#Question: what algorithm is used for pitch analysis?")
NORMAL (U"Answer: for how the raw pitch analysis method works, "
	"see @@Sound: To Pitch (ac)...@. The 1993 article is downloadable from "
	"https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/paul/")
NORMAL (U"#Question: why does Praat consider my sound voiceless while I hear it as voiced?")
NORMAL (U"There are at least five possibilities. Most of them can be checked by zooming in on the @waveform.")
NORMAL (U"The first possibility is that the pitch has fallen below the @@pitch floor@. For instance, "
	"your pitch floor could be 50 Hz but the English speaker produces creak at the end of the utterance. "
	"Or your pitch floor could be 50 Hz but the Chinese speaker is in the middle of a third tone. "
	"If this happens, it may help to lower the pitch floor to e.g. 30 Hz (@@Pitch settings...@), "
	"although that may also smooth the pitch curve too much in other places.")
NORMAL (U"The second possibility is that the pitch has moved too fast. This could happen at the end of a Chinese fourth tone, "
	"which drops very fast. If this happens, it may help to use the ##optimize for voice analysis# setting, "
	"(@@Pitch settings...@), although Praat may then hallucinate pitches in other places that you would prefer to consider voiceless.")
NORMAL (U"The third possibility is that the periods are very irregular, as in some pathological voices. "
	"If you want to see a pitch in those cases, it may help to use the ##optimize for voice analysis# setting "
	"(@@Pitch settings...@). Or it may help to lower the ##voicing threshold# setting (@@Advanced pitch settings (filtered AC and CC)...@) "
	"to 0.25 (instead of the standard 0.50) or so.")
NORMAL (U"The fourth possibility is that there is a lot of background noise, as in a recording on a busy street. "
	"In such a case, it may help to lower the ##voicing threshold# setting (@@Advanced pitch settings (filtered AC and CC)...@) "
	"to 0.25 (instead of the standard 0.50) or so. The disadvantage of lowering this setting is that for non-noisy "
	"recordings, Praat will become too eager to find voicing in some places that you would prefer to consider voiceless; "
	"so make sure to set it back to 0.50 once you have finished analysing the noisy recordings.")
NORMAL (U"The fifth possibility is that the part analysed as voiceless is much less loud than the rest of the sound, "
	"or that the sound contains a loud noise elsewhere. This can be checked by zooming in on the part analysed as voiceless: "
	"if Praat suddenly considers it as voiced, this is a sign that this part is much quieter than the rest. "
	"To make Praat analyse this part as voiced, you can lower the ##silence threshold# setting to 0.01 "
	"(instead of the standard 0.09) or so. The disadvantage of lowering this setting is that Praat may start to consider "
	"some distant background sounds (and quiet echos, for instance) as voiced.")
NORMAL (U"#Question: why do I get different results for the maximum pitch if...?")
NORMAL (U"If you select a Sound and choose @@Sound: To Pitch (filtered ac)...@, the time step will usually "
	"be 0.015 seconds. The resulting @Pitch object will have values for times that are "
	"0.015 seconds apart. If you then click Info or choose ##Get maximum pitch# from the @@Query submenu@, "
	"the result is based on those time points. By contrast, if you choose ##Get maximum pitch# "
	"from the @@Pitch menu@ in the SoundEditor window, the result will be based on the visible points, "
	"of which there tend to be a hundred in the visible window. These different time spacings will "
	"lead to slightly different pitch contours.")
NORMAL (U"If you choose ##Move cursor to maximum pitch#, then choose ##Get pitch# from the "
	"@@Pitch menu@, the result will be different again. This is because ##Get maximum pitch# "
	"can do a parabolic interpolation around the maximum, whereas ##Get pitch#, not realizing "
	"that the cursor is at a maximum, does a stupid linear interpolation, which tends to lead to "
	"lower values.")

CODE (U"Zoom: 0.3, 0.5")
NORMAL (U"Answer: Praat doesn’t know it has to send the #Zoom command to the editor "

	"screen. According to @@Scripting 7.1. Scripting an editor from a shell script@, "

NORMAL (U"")
NORMAL (U"#Question: why do names of variables have to start with a lower-case letter? "
	"I would like to do things like “`F0 = Get mean pitch`”.")
NORMAL (U"Answer: Praat scripts combine button commands with things that only occur "
	"in scripts. Button commands always start with a capital letter, e.g. `Play` (there is a button #Play). "
	"Script commands always start with lower case, e.g. `writeInfoLine: “Hello”` "
	"($writeInfoLine is a built-in function). "
	"A minimal pair is “$select”, which simulates a mouse click in the object list, "
	"versus “`Select...`”, which sets the selection in editor windows. If we allowed initial capitals, "
	"variable names would become rather ambiguous in assignments, "
	"as in “`x = Get`”, where “%`Get`” would be a variable, versus “`x = Get mean`”, "

ENTRY (U"Hey, there are white vertical stripes at the edges!")
NORMAL (U"This is normal. Spectral analysis requires an %%analysis window% of a certain duration. "
	"For instance, if Praat wants to know the spectrum at 1.342 seconds, it needs to include information "
	"about the signal in a 10-milliseconds window around this time point, i.e., Praat will use "
	"signal information about all times between 1.337 and 1.347 seconds. At the very edges of the sound, "

	"if the sound runs from 0 to 1.8 seconds, no spectrum can be computed between 0 and 0.005 "

	"But Praat did not forget what the signal looks like just outside the edges of this time window. "
	"To display a spectrogram from 0.45 to 1.35 seconds, Praat will use information from the wave form "
	"between 0.445 and 1.355 seconds, and if this is available, you will see no white stripes at the edges of the window.")
ENTRY (U"Hey, it changes when I scroll!")
NORMAL (U"This is normal as well, especially for long windows. If your visible time window is 20 seconds long, "
	"and the window takes up 1000 screen pixels horizontally, "
	"then you might think that every one-pixel-wide vertical line should represent the spectrum of 20 milliseconds of sound. "
	"But for reasons of computation speed, Praat will only show the spectrum of the part of the sound "
	"that lies around the centre of those 20 milliseconds, "
	"not the average or sum of all the spectra in those 20 milliseconds. "
	"This %undersampling of the underlying spectrogram is different from what happens in the drawing of the wave form, "
	"where a vertical black line connects the minimum and maximum amplitude of all the samples that fall inside a "
	"screen pixel. We cannot do something similar for spectrograms. And since scrolling goes by fixed time steps "
	"(namely, 5 percent of the duration of the visible window), rather than by a whole number of screen pixels, "
	"the centres of the pixels will fall in different parts of the spectrogram with each scroll. "
	"Hence the apparent changes. If your visible window is shorter than a couple of seconds, "
	"the scrolling spectrogram will appear much smoother.")
NORMAL (U"The darkness of the spectrogram will also change when you scroll, because the visible part with the most "

	"of the lines varies. The line gets thinner if you raise the window length. "
	"Apparently, if the analysis window comprises more periods of the wave, "

NORMAL (U"To see this more precisely, create a sum of two sine waves, with frequencies of 1000 and 1200 Hz. "
	"the formula is `1/4 * sin (2*pi*1000*x) + 1/4 * sin (2*pi*1200*x)`. In the editor, you will see "
	"a single thick band if the analysis window is short (5 ms), and two separate bands if the analysis "
	"window is long (30 ms). Apparently, the frequency resolution gets better with longer analysis windows.")
NORMAL (U"So why don't we always use long analysis windows? The answer is that their time resolution is poor. "
	"To see this, create a sound that consists of two sine waves and two short clicks. The formula is "
	"`0.02*(sin(2*pi*1000*x)+sin(2*pi*1200*x)) + (col=10000)+(col=10200)`. "
	"If you view this sound, you can see that the two clicks will overlap "
	"in time if the analysis window is long, and that the sine waves overlap in frequency if the "

	"The Gaussian window is superior, as it gives no %sidelobes in your spectrogram (see below); "

	"Praat will use the maximum of the visible part of the spectrogram instead; "

TERM (U"%%Preemphasis% (dB/octave)")
DEFINITION (U"determines the steepness of a high-pass filter, "

	"Since the spectral slope of human vowels is approximately -6 dB per octave, "
	"the standard value for this setting is +6 dB per octave, "

ENTRY (U"The %%pitch range% setting")
NORMAL (U"This is the most important setting for pitch analysis. The standard range is from 50 to 800 hertz, "
	"which means that the pitch analysis method will only find values between 50 and 800 Hz. "
	"The range that you set here will be shown to the right of the analysis window.")
NORMAL (U"You may have set the range to values appropriate for your speaker, "
	"because speakers can vary enormously in their pitch ranges. "
	"For some low-pitched (e.g. average male) voices, you might want to set the floor to 50 Hz, and the ceiling to 300 Hz; "
	"for some high-pitched (e.g. average female) voices, a range of 100-600 Hz might instead be appropriate; "
	"however, it may well be the case that the standard setting of 50–800 Hz will work for all of these voices. "
	"On the high side, however, some children can reach almost 2000 Hz when yelling; "
	"on the low side, creaky voice can go as low as 30 Hz; "
	"if you investigate such cases, you may therefore want to experiment with this setting.")
NORMAL (U"Here is why you have to supply these settings. If the pitch floor is 50 Hz, "
	"the pitch analysis method requires a 60-millisecond analysis window, "
	"i.e., in order to measure the F0 at a time of, say, 0.850 seconds, "
	"Praat needs to consider a part of the sound that runs from 0.820 to 0.880 seconds. "
	"These 60 milliseconds correspond to 3 maximum pitch periods (3/50 = 0.060). "
	"If you set the pitch floor down to 25 Hz, the analysis window will grow to 120 milliseconds "
	"(which is again 3 maximum pitch periods), i.e., all times between 0.790 and 0.910 seconds will be considered. "
	"This makes it less easy to see fast F0 changes.")
NORMAL (U"So setting the floor of the pitch range is a technical requirement for the pitch analysis. "

Praat aims at being a fully international program:
the texts in Praat’s TextGrids, Tables, scripts, or Info window (and elsewhere) can contain many types of characters
(see @@special symbols@).
For this reason, Praat saves its text files in one of two possible formats: UTF-8 (including ASCII) or UTF-16.

ASCII text files
================

If your TextGrid (or Table, or script, or Info window...) contains only characters that can be encoded as ASCII,
namely the characters `!\"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_`` abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~`,
then when you say @@Save as text file...@ or #Save, Praat will write an ASCII text file,
which is a text file in which every character is encoded in a single byte (8 bits).
All programs that can read plain text files can read such files produced by Praat.

UTF-16 text files
=================

If your TextGrid (or Table, or script, or Info window...) contains one or more characters that cannot be encoded as ASCII,
for instance West-European characters such as \ao\c,\e'\o"\ss\?d, East-European characters such as \c<\l/\o:\s<\uo\z',
or Hebrew characters such as \?+\B+\G+\M%\vO\sU,
then when you say @@Save as text file...@ or #Save, Praat will write an UTF-16 text file,
which is a text file in which every character is encoded in two bytes (and some very rare characters in four bytes).
Many programs can read such text files, for instance NotePad, WordPad, Microsoft Word, and TextWrangler.

What if my other programs cannot read UTF-16 text files?
========================================================

If you want to export your Table to Microsoft Excel or to SPSS, or if you want your TextGrid file to be read
by somebody else's Perl script, then there will be no problem if your Table contains only ASCII characters (see above).
But if your Table contains any other (i.e. non-ASCII) characters, you may be in trouble, because Praat will write the Table
as an UTF-16 text file, and not all of the programs just mentioned can read such files yet.

What you can do is go to ##Text writing settings...# in the #Settings submenu of the #Praat menu,
and there set the output encoding to ##UTF-8#. Praat will from then on save your text files in the UTF-8 format,
which means one byte for every ASCII character and 2 to 4 bytes for every non-ASCII character.
Especially on Linux, many programs understand UTF-8 text and will display the correct characters.
Programs such as SPSS do not understand UTF-8 but will still display ASCII characters correctly;
for instance, the names München and Wałęsa may appear as M\A~\:-nchen and Wa\Ao,\A"\TMsa or so.

If you can get by with West-European characters (on Windows),
then you may choose ##try ISO Latin-1, then UTF-16# for the output encoding.
It is possible (but not guaranteed) that programs like SPSS then display your West-European text correctly.
This trick is of limited use, because it will not work if your operating system is set to a “codepage”
differently from ISO Latin-1 (or “ANSI”), or if you need East-European or Hebrew characters, or if you want
to share your text files with Macintosh users.

If you already have some UTF-16 text files and you want to convert them to UTF-8 or ISO Latin-1 (the latter only if
they do not contain non-West-European characters), then you can read them into Praat and save them again
(with the appropriate output encoding setting).
Other programs, such a NotePad and TextWrangler, can also do this conversion.

Finally, it is still possible to make sure that all texts are ASCII, e.g. you type the characters ß and ő
as “`\ss`” and “`\o:`” respectively. See @@special symbols@.
