	"The window length determines the %bandwidth of the spectral analysis, i.e. the width of the horizontal line "

	"or 1.2982804 / %%Window length%. "
	"To get a `broad-band' spectrogram (bandwidth 260 Hz), set %%Window length% to 5 milliseconds; "

TAG (U"##Time step (s)")
DEFINITION (U"the distance between the centres of subsequent frames, e.g. 0.002 seconds. "
	"This determines the number of frames of the resulting Spectrogram. For instance, if the Sound is 1 second long, "
	"and the time step is 2 milliseconds, the Spectrogram will consist of almost 500 frames "
	"(not %exactly 500, because no reliable spectrum can be measured near the beginning and end of the sound). "
	"See below for cases in which the time step of the resulting Spectrogram is different from what you supply here.")
TAG (U"##Frequency step (Hz)")
DEFINITION (U"the frequency resolution, e.g. 20 Hertz. "
	"This determines the number of frequency bands (%bins) of the resulting Spectrogram. For instance, if the %%Maximum frequency% "
	"is 5000 Hz, and the frequency step is 20 Hz, the Spectrogram will consist of 250 frequency bands. "
	"See below for cases in which the frequency step of the resulting Spectrogram is different from what you supply here.")
TAG (U"##Window shape")
DEFINITION (U"determines the shape of the analysis window. "
	"You can choose from: #Gaussian, #Square (none, rectangular), #Hamming (raised sine-squared), "
	"#Bartlett (triangular), #Welch (parabolic), and #Hanning (sine-squared). "
	"The Gaussian window is superior, as it gives no sidelobes in your spectrogram; "
	"it analyzes a factor of 2 slower than the other window shapes, "
	"because the analysis is actually performed on twice as many samples per frame.")
NORMAL (U"For purposes of computation speed, Praat may decide to change the time step and the frequency step. "
	"This is because the time step never needs to be smaller than 1/(8√%π) of the window length, "
	"and the frequency step never needs to be smaller than (√%π)/8 of the inverse of the window length. "
	"For instance, if the window length is 29 ms, the actual time step will never be less than 29/(8√%π) = 2.045 ms. "

NORMAL (U"If %N is odd, there will be %N frequency samples. For instance, if the sound has 20,457 samples, "
