/*
1. The Hilbert transform.

I wondered whether my use of taking the square was worse than taking
the Hilbert envelope. My formula is

   my_envelope1(t) = x(t) ^ 2

For a sampled signal, this introduces higher frequencies, so I should have
filtered the signal at half the Nyquist frequency to prevent aliasing. I wonder
how the Hilbert envelope behaves in this respect:

   your_envelope1(t) = x(t) ^ 2 + Px(t) ^ 2

I think it has the same problem, since it involves squaring the real and imaginary parts.

Of course, the Hilbert transform is much smoother, but that cannot matter for
frequencies above 100 Hz or so, since we are going to filter at 30 Hz anyway.
Thus, I think these methods are comparable. Do you agree?


2. The non-linearity.

In the second step, I take the logarithm:

   my_envelope2(t) = 10 log10 (my_envelope1(t) + 1e-6)

Of course, the 1e-6 is there to guard against zero values in my_envelope1.
I took the logarithm because it can handle negative values, which will arise
in the filtering process. You take the square root instead:

   your_envelope2(t) = sqrt (your_envelope1(t))


3. Filtering between 3 and 30 Hz.

You use a second-order Butterworth filter in the time domain:

   your_envelope3(t) = your_envelope2(t) * Butterworth(t)

What do you mean by "forward and backward filtering"?
Did you use the second-order filter twice, thus making it fourth-order effectively?

My alternative was to use the two Gaussians:

   my_spectrum2(f) = fft (my_envelope2(t))
   my_spectrum3(f) = my_spectrum2(f) (exp(-(f/35)^2)-exp(-(f/3.5)^2)
   my_envelope3(t) = ifft (my_spectrum3 (f))

This is a filter with several desirable properties: no ringing, phase-preserving,
an area of zero. On the other hand, it is not causal, but I think that that is not
an issue here. Is it?


4. The new band.

In my algorithm, I have to undo the non-linearity:

   my_envelope4(t) = 10 ^ (my_envelope3(t) / 2)

You see that I divide by 2, not 10, thus effectively multiplying the dynamics,
expressed in dB, by a factor of 5. Since I am going to use the new envelope as
a multiplication factor, I will have to limit it to a factor of 10, because the
maximum enhancement is 20 dB. But this limiting factor is band-dependent:

   ceiling(Fmid) = 1 + 9 (1/2 - 1/2 cos (pi Fmid / 13))

where Fmid is expressed in Bark. The limiting is done smoothly:

   my_envelope5(t) = 1 / (1 / my_envelope4(t) + 1 / ceiling)

So this is the final multiplication factor for the band-filtered signal:

   new_band(t) = x(t) my_envelope5(t)

Your multiplication factor is very different. Please tell me whether I am correct.

   your_envelope4(t) = rectify (your_envelope3(t))

This step is needed because you cannot handle negative values. It introduces
higher-frequency components, which will have to be filtered out later.
The new signal will have to carry the new envelope, so the multiplication
factor is taken relative to the envelope of the original signal:

   your_envelope5(t) = your_envelope4(t) / your_envelope2(t)

The components that were introduced by the rectification must be thrown out:

   your_envelope6(t) = your_envelope5(t) * Butterworth?(t)

What were the characteristics of that filter? You did not specify them in your paper.
Well, the next step is normalization to the power of the original band:

   new_band(t) = your_envelope6(t) ||x(t)|| / ||your_envelope5(t)||

At least, that's your formula (12). I suppose that it contains a mistake, and that
the norm in the denominator should refer to the filtered your_envelope6(t) instead?

By the normalization, the fast movements within each band have been strengtened,
and the slow parts have been weakened. Thus, there is dynamic expansion within
each band, whereas my algorithm has this only in the mid frequency range, am I correct?
Could you also explain figure 5 to me? Some of the thick curves show enhanced peaks,
but how about the valleys, are some of them deepened as well?


5. The new signal.

My algorithm simply adds all the bands:

   new_signal(t) = SUM new_band(Fmid,t)

The mid-frequency bands are favoured because they have stronger modulation deepening
than the other bands. In your algorithm, the favouring of the mid frequencies is
implemented in the last step:

   new_signal(t) = SUM new_band(Fmid,t) gain(Fmid)

This would mean, for instance, that if the modulation is not deepened (for instance
if there are no fast movements), the mid-frequency range is still multiplied by a factor
of 10, whereas my algorithm would not change the signal at all in such a case. Is that so?

If so, could any of the learning results have been produced by the general emphasis
in the 1-4 kHz range? Have you any proof that the modulation deepening itself
is the cause of the learning results?

So the differences between the two algorithms are clear now: mine does modulation
deepening selectively in the F2 range, yours does modulation deepening everywhere
plus an independent emphasis in the F2 range. Since both algorithms will lead to
emphasis in the F2 range, that leaves the question of whether a modulation change
is necessary for the other frequency bands. Have you any idea, or was your choice
for this just one of the minor decisions while constructing your algorithm?

To sum up, I think that both algorithms perform what they were intended to do,
namely selectively enhancing fast F2 transitions. If you agree with this, I may
advise XXX to use my algorithm without change. I would, however, welcome any
suggestions as to oversights in my implementation, or other possible problems
or incorrect choices.
