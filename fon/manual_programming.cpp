	"an exclamation mark.")

	"As usual, most of the contents of the file is comments; for instance, older TextGrid files may call "
	"the time of the point $time instead of $number, but as these are just comments, Praat will ignore these words "
	"when reading the file, and so should anybody who programs a TextGrid file parser.")
NORMAL (U"A thing to note is the doubling of double quotes. The sentence in tier 1 contains double quotes around %ahoj, "
	"as you can see in the picture above, and you typed only these two double quotes in the TextGrid window to start with. "
	"However, the file format uses double quotes to mark texts, so if a text itself contains a double quote, "
	"something special has to be done about it lest Praat think that you're ending the text. The solution that Praat chooses "
	"is that a double quote that appears in a text is written as a %doubled double quote in the text file, as above on tier 1.")
ENTRY (U"6. Restrictions in a TextGrid object")
NORMAL (U"TextGrid objects maintain several invariants, some stronger and some weaker.")
NORMAL (U"The two strongest invariants within an interval tier are %%positive duration% and %adjacency. "
	"That is, the end time of each interval has to be greater than the starting time of that same interval, "
	"and the starting time of each interval (except the first) has to be equal to the end time of the previous interval. "
	"As a result, the union of the time domains of the set of intervals in a tier is a contiguous stretch of time, "
	"and no intervals overlap. If a TextGrid file violates these invariants, Praat may refuse to read the file and give "
	"an error message instead (or Praat may try to repair the TextGrid, but that is not guaranteed).")
NORMAL (U"A weaker invariant is that the starting time of the first interval on a tier equals the starting time of that tier, "
	"and the end time of the last interval equals the end time of the tier. When you create a TextGrid with Praat, "
	"this invariant is automatically maintained, and most types of modifications also maintain it, except sometimes the commands "
	"that combine multiple TextGrid objects with different durations into a new TextGrid. "
	"Praat will happily read TextGrid files that do not honour this weak invariant, and will also display such a TextGrid "
	"reasonably well in a TextGrid window. It is nevertheless advisable for other programs that create TextGrids "
	"to honour this weak invariant.")
NORMAL (U"For a point tier, a strong invariant is that the time of each point (except the first) has to be greater than the time "
	"of the previous point. Praat maintains this invariant for instance by refusing to insert a point at the time of an existing "
	"point. TextGrid files that violate this invariant may or may not be read by Praat, and may cause strange behaviour in Praat "
	"if they are read.")
NORMAL (U"A further weak invariant is that the starting and end times of each tier equal the starting and end times of the whole "
	"TextGrid. This can be violated by combining multiple TextGrids into one, but other programs are advised to create TextGrids "
	"that honour this invariant, because TextGrids that violate it may look strange to the user.")
ENTRY (U"7. Text encoding")
NORMAL (U"Existing TextGrid text files come in various encodings. When creating a parser for TextGrid text files, "
	"you should be prepared for reading it in UTF-8 encoding (without Byte Order Mark), or in UTF-16 encoding "
	"(either Big-Endian or Little-Endian, with Byte Order Mark). Pre-Unicode TextGrid text files may have a Latin-1 encoding "
	"if they were created on Windows or Linux, or a MacRoman encoding if they were created on a Mac, "
	"so it would be good to prepare for such old files as well, although it may be difficult to figure out which is which "
	"(line separators, as described below, may help).")
NORMAL (U"When writing a TextGrid text file, you can use UTF-8 encoding (without Byte Order Mark), or UTF-16 encoding "
	"(either Big-Endian or Little-Endian, with Byte Order Mark). "
	"Please never write a limited encoding such as Latin-1 or MacRoman, which do not support international characters "
	"or phonetic characters as in $$\"ʔaɦɔj\"$.")
NORMAL (U"The lines in the file are typically separated by a newline symbol (Linux or modern Mac), "
	"or by a Return symbol (old Mac), or by a Return symbol followed by a newline symbol (Windows). "
	"When reading a TextGrid text file, you should be prepared for each of these line separators. "
	"When writing a TextGrid text file, you can use any of these line separators, because most text editors "
	"on all platforms can meanwhile open and view all these versions correctly.")
ENTRY (U"8. Interpreting trigraphs")
NORMAL (U"The example above contains several phonetic symbols, and it is not always easy to type those into a text field. "
	"For this reason, Praat provides %trigraphs for most phonetic characters, as well as for many non-ASCII characters "
	"used in the languages of the world. For instance, the vowel \"ɔ\" (a \"turned c\") can be typed as \"\\bsct\" into "
	"the TextGrid window as well as anywhere else in Praat where you want to draw graphical text "
